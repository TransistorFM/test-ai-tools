Hey, product people, justin Jackson here and I've got

3
00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:22.238
a brand new interview for you with

4
00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:25.874
James Clear, who is the author

5
00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:29.590
of Atomic Habits, a book that has

6
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.918
really changed my life since I've read it.

7
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.758
And I don't want to give too much of an intro. I just want to

8
00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:40.314
get right into the actual interview. If you like

9
00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:43.482
this, please reach out to James on Twitter at

10
00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:47.142
jamesclear. And if you have comments about the episode,

11
00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:50.570
reach out to me on Twitter. I'm the letter M. The letter I.

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.190
Justin. M I Justin. Here is me

13
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.706
and James talking about habits

14
00:00:57.898 --> 00:01:01.486
and how you can make your life better one day at a

15
00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:02.080
time.

16
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.638
The book your book's been out for a while. It's right here. Tomic Habits.

17
00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:16.406
If you see it in an airport or something near you,

18
00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:19.958
how long has it been out now? Today

19
00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:23.830
is 100 days. Exactly. No way. Yeah, so

20
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.374
just over three months. I'm curious

21
00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:30.620
because now it's been out for a while.

22
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.098
Is there one idea that your see

23
00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:39.082
that people keep sharing? Like one idea that resonated from the book

24
00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:42.822
in particular that gets shared more than anything else on Twitter

25
00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:46.474
or wherever? So I was

26
00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:50.078
curious about that myself when I was writing the book and thinking about it because

27
00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:53.806
I kind of felt like, all know, hopefully all these

28
00:01:53.828 --> 00:01:56.814
ideas are useful, but what's the one thing that people are going to latch onto?

29
00:01:56.862 --> 00:02:00.622
Because sometimes you'll hear that from authors that there was one chapter

30
00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:04.098
or something that was the chapter that really stuck with people.

31
00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:07.766
Yeah. I'm grateful for the fact that there are a variety of

32
00:02:07.788 --> 00:02:08.840
things, but

33
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.010
there are a few things. So the first one is Identity Based Habits,

34
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.230
which is chapter two. And that

35
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.074
concept really seems to have resonated with people. The

36
00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:25.946
idea of trying to reinforce your desired identity and kind of starting with

37
00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:29.114
who you want to become rather than what you want to achieve. Yes,

38
00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:33.018
and I'm glad that it did, because that was the

39
00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:36.734
chapter I debated over the most of where to put it in the book. I

40
00:02:36.772 --> 00:02:40.382
had it at different points. It was the first chapter, it was the last

41
00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:44.174
chapter. It ended up being the second one. I also had this thought

42
00:02:44.212 --> 00:02:47.886
in my head that it should be like about midway through the book, so it

43
00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:51.666
really jumped all over the place. But I ended up thinking, I feel like this

44
00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:54.594
is one of the best ideas, so I want to have it early so that

45
00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:58.006
people, even if they don't finish the book, they still come across this idea.

46
00:02:58.188 --> 00:03:01.414
And I'm glad that that ended up working out

47
00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:05.206
well. The other one that people bring up a lot

48
00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:08.834
is the two minute rule and the idea of scaling your habits

49
00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:12.614
down to the point where they take two minutes or less. I think that

50
00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:16.394
that's life a very actionable one. It's like, okay, I know exactly what to do.

51
00:03:16.432 --> 00:03:19.686
I wanted to do a workout, but now I'll just focus on doing five push

52
00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:23.366
ups or I wanted to read 30 books this year and now I'll

53
00:03:23.398 --> 00:03:27.086
focus on reading one page a day or something like that. Got you. So I

54
00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:30.926
think the actionableness of that one also tends to stick. And

55
00:03:30.948 --> 00:03:33.440
so going back to the identity one,

56
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.002
is this the idea that every

57
00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:41.826
action you take or every habit you develop is a vote for the

58
00:03:41.848 --> 00:03:45.334
person you want to become? Right? So that's kind of like my

59
00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:49.062
core philosophy behind it. This idea

60
00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:52.454
that the way that we develop

61
00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:56.242
beliefs about ourselves, that we reinforce our self image,

62
00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:59.734
that we develop our identity to a certain degree

63
00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:03.434
is largely reinforced by the experiences and

64
00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:07.114
behaviors that we perform over time. So some aspects of your

65
00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:10.486
identity are relatively fixed. Like for example, if you're tall or

66
00:04:10.528 --> 00:04:14.286
short. But even that idea that I am tall or I

67
00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:18.046
am short, that's reinforced. You learn that through experiences in

68
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:21.898
life. Now, there are many aspects of your identity

69
00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:25.826
that are less fixed than that but are still reinforced by

70
00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:27.540
your experiences. So

71
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.646
if you write one sentence today, you probably don't

72
00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:37.218
think about yourself as I am a writer, but if your do that every day

73
00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:41.094
for six months or nine months or a year, at some point your turn around

74
00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:44.520
and you think, maybe I am the kind of person who is a writer. Or

75
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.430
if you study biology every Tuesday night for 20 minutes,

76
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.306
you at some point think, I guess I'm studious. I keep doing this every

77
00:04:53.328 --> 00:04:57.082
week. Maybe this is the kind of person I am. And so I like that

78
00:04:57.136 --> 00:05:00.906
idea that our habits are like votes for the type of

79
00:05:00.928 --> 00:05:04.654
person we believe that we are, that they build up evidence of looking

80
00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:08.382
at ourselves in a certain way. And I like to

81
00:05:08.436 --> 00:05:12.240
phrase it that way not only because I believe it's true, but also

82
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.874
beliefs and behavior are kind of a two way street, right?

83
00:05:15.912 --> 00:05:19.602
So you'll hear people say things like, well,

84
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:23.234
just be positive or just believe in yourself or fake it till you make it

85
00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:26.958
or things like that. And there's nothing necessarily

86
00:05:27.054 --> 00:05:30.726
wrong with fake it till you make it. It's fine to be positive and

87
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:34.114
believe things about yourself. But it's a very short term

88
00:05:34.162 --> 00:05:38.006
strategy because fake it till you make it is asking you to

89
00:05:38.028 --> 00:05:41.846
believe something about yourself without having evidence for it. It's like

90
00:05:41.868 --> 00:05:45.658
that kind of visualization stuff or mantra stuff where you look at yourself in

91
00:05:45.664 --> 00:05:48.394
the mirror and you tell yourself I am a writer. I am a writer, even

92
00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:51.894
though you haven't written yet. And so what I'm saying is

93
00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:55.582
similar, but I think importantly different in the sense

94
00:05:55.636 --> 00:05:59.450
that you let the behavior lead the way rather than the belief.

95
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.306
And I think that's the best lever we have for changing

96
00:06:03.338 --> 00:06:06.734
the way that we look at ourselves, which is to say show up and write

97
00:06:06.772 --> 00:06:10.434
a sentence every day, and soon you're going to have something to root that new

98
00:06:10.472 --> 00:06:14.274
identity of I am a writer in. And it's a much more, I think,

99
00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:17.814
robust and long term way of changing how you look at yourself. Yeah, I think

100
00:06:17.852 --> 00:06:21.590
for the because you first

101
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.174
communicated that idea to me in an

102
00:06:25.212 --> 00:06:28.826
airport in Denver. Yeah, I remember that.

103
00:06:28.928 --> 00:06:32.666
And at the time in my life, I was

104
00:06:32.688 --> 00:06:36.150
not doing so good. I was depressed.

105
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.962
I think cynical, especially, I think cynical about people

106
00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:43.630
like you that seem to have it all together, that seem to be really

107
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.406
life, doing all the good habits. And

108
00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:51.214
when you're not doing so good, looking at

109
00:06:51.252 --> 00:06:54.420
someone that seems to have it all together

110
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.802
just can make you more grumpy or more cynical or more

111
00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:02.340
whatever. But I remember you sitting down

112
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.182
and kind of hashing this out with me and that

113
00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:10.086
idea of Justin, no

114
00:07:10.108 --> 00:07:13.666
matter where you're at right now and no matter what you've

115
00:07:13.698 --> 00:07:17.222
done, you could start today with

116
00:07:17.356 --> 00:07:20.534
one action. So if you

117
00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:24.378
go running today, that might not make

118
00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:28.010
a big difference. But then if you do it tomorrow and then the next day

119
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.898
and then the next day and then the next day, at the end of

120
00:07:31.904 --> 00:07:34.880
the week, you might say, well, wait a second,

121
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.406
I think I'm a runner, right? And maybe after a couple

122
00:07:39.428 --> 00:07:41.754
of weeks you might say, well, you know, I'm going to get myself some runner

123
00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:44.642
clothes and go and get some runner clothes and then I'm going to get myself

124
00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:48.500
a good pair of shoes. I'm going to install that strava app.

125
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.706
And all of a sudden you could see yourself. That

126
00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:56.242
was a really hopeful message for me when I was really

127
00:07:56.296 --> 00:08:00.038
struggling to figure out it was way easier for me to be cynical and

128
00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:03.782
just kind of look back at all these people implementing good,

129
00:08:03.836 --> 00:08:07.506
healthy processes and say, well, that's not for me. That's just for

130
00:08:07.548 --> 00:08:09.980
people. That whatever. But

131
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.474
hearing that gave me hope to think I could do

132
00:08:14.512 --> 00:08:18.234
that, and it's surprising how

133
00:08:18.272 --> 00:08:21.754
little time it takes to accomplish

134
00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:25.614
that. Have other

135
00:08:25.652 --> 00:08:29.182
people been kind of referencing that too? Is that

136
00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:32.894
part of the and maybe that's what's so good about having it as

137
00:08:32.932 --> 00:08:36.514
chapter two, because it gives your some hope. Right. Well,

138
00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:40.254
what's interesting is that that process of changing in that way, it's

139
00:08:40.302 --> 00:08:43.934
happening anyway. If you think back to the beginning,

140
00:08:44.062 --> 00:08:47.902
for example, if I think of the early days of my entrepreneurial career,

141
00:08:48.046 --> 00:08:51.702
well, I didn't have any entrepreneurs in my family. I didn't have any close friends

142
00:08:51.756 --> 00:08:55.478
who are entrepreneurs. There was no reason for me to think that's who I am

143
00:08:55.564 --> 00:08:58.966
or to feel like I was externally validated with, like that was part of my

144
00:08:58.988 --> 00:09:02.806
identity. I had no evidence of it. And so early on, all

145
00:09:02.828 --> 00:09:05.738
I had was hope. Right? Like the hope that, oh, maybe I'll be able to

146
00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:09.498
build something, make I'll be able to make this work, but then you start to

147
00:09:09.504 --> 00:09:13.194
show up. And for me, it was probably about two years in is probably

148
00:09:13.232 --> 00:09:16.926
about where I kind of like the scale tipped, and I started to

149
00:09:16.948 --> 00:09:20.686
think, I am an entrepreneur. That's part of who I am. But

150
00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:24.302
it really took proving it to myself that I can

151
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:28.050
pay my bills through this, that I can actually

152
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.586
have a lifestyle and a career in this way. I had to prove it for

153
00:09:31.608 --> 00:09:35.366
about two years before I really started to latch onto it and say, this is

154
00:09:35.388 --> 00:09:36.600
who I am. Yeah,

155
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.880
my point is that's always happening.

156
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.806
You're continually updating your beliefs about yourself based on the

157
00:09:46.828 --> 00:09:50.102
experiences that you're going through. And all I'm talking about is

158
00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:53.814
simply designing that process in a little more careful

159
00:09:53.862 --> 00:09:57.386
or thoughtful way, rather than just kind of letting it happen to you and be

160
00:09:57.408 --> 00:10:00.566
like, well, I guess I'll figure out who I am. Based on what life throws

161
00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:04.238
at me versus how about I figure out who I am based on the

162
00:10:04.244 --> 00:10:08.046
votes that I cast each day and what habits I decide to follow.

163
00:10:08.148 --> 00:10:11.514
Yeah. Again, that is a very hopeful

164
00:10:11.562 --> 00:10:14.946
message for someone who's just kind of sitting back and waiting for it to

165
00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:18.450
happen. What sustains you

166
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.162
when you're in the process but

167
00:10:22.216 --> 00:10:25.922
not there yet? Like you mentioned,

168
00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:28.840
entrepreneur and your, like, man, it took a long time.

169
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.906
It's a really good question because I think a lot of habits, entrepreneurship

170
00:10:33.938 --> 00:10:37.080
is certainly this way, exercise is this way, where

171
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.890
the rewards of a habit are often very

172
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.582
delayed. What's the reward

173
00:10:44.646 --> 00:10:48.294
for working out for, like, three weeks? Not really a whole lot. Honestly.

174
00:10:48.342 --> 00:10:52.140
Your body hasn't really changed. The scale is probably about the same.

175
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.366
You're probably just sore. There probably isn't like, a whole lot to

176
00:10:56.388 --> 00:11:00.142
show for it. It's really not unless you stick with that habit for

177
00:11:00.196 --> 00:11:03.854
three months or six months or a year that you actually start to see

178
00:11:03.892 --> 00:11:07.698
the changes you were hoping to get when you set out. And so there's kind

179
00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:11.554
of this valley of death in the beginning where, in

180
00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:15.182
a way, it sort of life gets harder before it gets easier. It feels

181
00:11:15.246 --> 00:11:18.434
uncomfortable. You feel sore and pain. You feel

182
00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:22.166
uncertain. When you walk in the gym, you feel like people are judging you. Same

183
00:11:22.188 --> 00:11:25.638
way with starting a business. In a weird way, it's kind of harder before it

184
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:29.366
gets easier. You start out, but you're not making any money. You feel stupid a

185
00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:32.714
lot of the time because you don't know how to make a sales call or

186
00:11:32.752 --> 00:11:36.154
what customers are looking for or whether you're even offering the right

187
00:11:36.192 --> 00:11:39.180
product. I remember when I first started,

188
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.578
like I said, I didn't know anybody, didn't have any entrepreneurs in my family. So

189
00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:46.174
I was like, well, I need to get to know some people. So I sent

190
00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:49.246
a bunch of emails to reach out and just ask if people would chat on

191
00:11:49.268 --> 00:11:52.974
Skype for like 30 minutes or whatever. And I remember sending those first

192
00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:56.786
few and thinking, do people even do this? Do people chat on Skype with

193
00:11:56.808 --> 00:12:00.306
people that they haven't met before? Is this a weird thing to ask? There's just

194
00:12:00.328 --> 00:12:03.954
a lot of that uncertainty early on. Yeah. So your

195
00:12:03.992 --> 00:12:06.898
point is, I think, a valid one, which is, well, what do you do to

196
00:12:06.904 --> 00:12:10.646
get through that? How do you kind of get through that valley of

197
00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:14.486
death while you're waiting for the long term rewards to accumulate? Yeah, and I

198
00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:18.134
think that this is where psychologists call it

199
00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:21.466
reinforcement or an external reinforcer, but

200
00:12:21.648 --> 00:12:25.146
you want some kind of reinforcement that is enjoyable in the

201
00:12:25.168 --> 00:12:28.380
moment so that you have a reason to keep showing up. Okay. So

202
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.502
from a habit standpoint, there are kind of two ways to do this. First

203
00:12:33.556 --> 00:12:37.406
thing is just a strategic choice about what type of habit you

204
00:12:37.428 --> 00:12:41.134
choose to follow. So if we go back to the exercise example,

205
00:12:41.332 --> 00:12:44.846
well, not everybody has to work out like a bodybuilder. You could

206
00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:48.586
do Pilates or yoga or go for a run or rock

207
00:12:48.618 --> 00:12:52.462
climbing or all kinds of stuff. And so pick

208
00:12:52.516 --> 00:12:56.134
the form of a habit that brings you the most joy, that is

209
00:12:56.172 --> 00:12:59.926
most enjoyable to you. It's going to be a slog for you're going to have

210
00:12:59.948 --> 00:13:02.518
to swim for months to see a change in your body. Your going to have

211
00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:05.458
to cycle for months. You're going to have to lift weights for months. It doesn't

212
00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:08.806
really matter which one you choose. It's going to take a while. So you might

213
00:13:08.828 --> 00:13:12.280
as well choose the one that's most exciting or enjoyable to you. Yeah.

214
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.746
Same way with imagine a reading habit. You don't have to

215
00:13:16.768 --> 00:13:19.402
read. You might feel life, oh, I have a business, so I need to read

216
00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:23.258
business books. But really, ultimately the most important thing is, do you get in

217
00:13:23.264 --> 00:13:27.006
the habit of reading? Do you fall in love with reading? So if you need

218
00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:30.814
to start with Sci-Fi books or fantasy or something like that,

219
00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:34.522
well, start with that. Do the one that is intrinsically

220
00:13:34.586 --> 00:13:38.114
valuable to you at first. And once the habit is built, then you can

221
00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:41.554
transition to some of the other stuff. Yeah. So that's one

222
00:13:41.592 --> 00:13:45.334
method for kind of getting through that valley of death. Yeah. And I

223
00:13:45.372 --> 00:13:48.562
think this brings up maybe a harder

224
00:13:48.626 --> 00:13:51.640
question, which is

225
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.366
based on your book, it's January and

226
00:13:57.388 --> 00:14:00.874
I'm thinking, okay, I haven't been in the gym for seven years.

227
00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:04.746
I used to love working out. I'm going to go, I got my

228
00:14:04.768 --> 00:14:07.740
Streaks app on my phone, start going.

229
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.902
And I don't know, I've probably

230
00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:15.326
been at least 18 days or maybe even 20 days this

231
00:14:15.348 --> 00:14:19.002
month. So it's great. And I was surprised

232
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:22.734
by how fast I felt. So the first

233
00:14:22.772 --> 00:14:26.526
day I felt like I didn't belong. Felt awkward. I don't know anybody here. I'm

234
00:14:26.558 --> 00:14:30.382
walking in some of the machinery I recognize,

235
00:14:30.446 --> 00:14:34.194
some I don't I have to get back into

236
00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:37.560
a routine. I have to find which exercise I'm going to do.

237
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.240
There's all these kind of insecurities and questions,

238
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.086
but after a week, I kind of felt like I

239
00:14:46.108 --> 00:14:49.626
belonged. But I wonder if that's because it

240
00:14:49.648 --> 00:14:51.900
was easier for me.

241
00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.266
I was already relatively in shape. So

242
00:15:00.288 --> 00:15:03.866
there's a big difference between going in where you feel like, oh, maybe I'm

243
00:15:03.898 --> 00:15:07.146
a few pounds overweight and going in and being 200 pounds

244
00:15:07.178 --> 00:15:10.942
overweight. There's a big difference between going in even

245
00:15:10.996 --> 00:15:14.394
as a white male, compared

246
00:15:14.442 --> 00:15:18.206
to there's a big difference going in and feeling like, well,

247
00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:22.030
I've done these exercises before, so I'm not completely out of my element.

248
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.640
And I'm wondering how

249
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.086
I mean, are are habits like that

250
00:15:30.188 --> 00:15:33.926
achievable because of privilege and context and other things?

251
00:15:33.948 --> 00:15:37.000
Like, how much does that play into it? And

252
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.886
if someone is walking in and they're 200 pounds

253
00:15:40.918 --> 00:15:44.666
overweight, do they still have the

254
00:15:44.688 --> 00:15:48.474
same chance of progress and success? It just feels like

255
00:15:48.512 --> 00:15:51.754
such a big mountain for them to go over. For

256
00:15:51.792 --> 00:15:55.518
sure. Yeah. So this is one reason why I

257
00:15:55.524 --> 00:15:58.862
think starting with small habits is so incredibly important.

258
00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:02.622
Because a lot of the time when we think about the outcome that you want

259
00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:06.080
so just to continue your weight loss or exercise, example,

260
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.346
everybody gets wrapped up in like, oh, I want to lose 100 pounds, or I

261
00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:12.914
want to lose 20 pounds or whatever the number is. But you

262
00:16:12.952 --> 00:16:16.494
forget about there are all these little logistical and emotional

263
00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:20.222
details that come along with starting a new habit. Yeah.

264
00:16:20.296 --> 00:16:23.846
So I'll often tell the story about I have this reader who he ended up

265
00:16:23.868 --> 00:16:27.638
losing over 100 pounds, and one of the first things he did was he went

266
00:16:27.644 --> 00:16:31.254
to the gym, but he wasn't allowed to stay for longer than five minutes. So

267
00:16:31.372 --> 00:16:35.066
he drove to the gym, got out of the car, did half an exercise, got

268
00:16:35.088 --> 00:16:38.906
back in the car, drove home. And it sounds ridiculous to people. It

269
00:16:38.928 --> 00:16:42.666
sounds silly because it's like, well, clearly exercising for five minutes is

270
00:16:42.688 --> 00:16:46.350
not going to get you in shape. But what you realize is

271
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.206
he was mastering the art of showing up. Right. He was becoming the type of

272
00:16:50.228 --> 00:16:54.030
person that drove to the gym every day. And when you're in that

273
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.762
state, for him at that point, that was the biggest shift, was,

274
00:16:57.896 --> 00:17:01.710
can I just become the type of person who gets in here? Right. Who overcomes

275
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.182
the uncertainty or feeling uncomfortable or feeling judged?

276
00:17:05.326 --> 00:17:09.170
And all those things are very real hurdles to building a habit.

277
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:13.222
There are all these little questions that need to be answered for something like that.

278
00:17:13.276 --> 00:17:17.126
Like, okay, I want to go to the gym. Well, what time am I going

279
00:17:17.148 --> 00:17:20.086
to go? Am I going to go before work or after work? What gym will

280
00:17:20.108 --> 00:17:23.706
I go to? What route am I going to take to get there? Do I

281
00:17:23.728 --> 00:17:26.506
need to bring a water bottle or is there like a water fountain at the

282
00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:30.220
gym? And all those little questions like that,

283
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.474
whether or not there's a water fountain at the gym. It sounds small,

284
00:17:34.592 --> 00:17:38.286
but if you already feel uncomfortable and feel like your don't belong and

285
00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:41.006
then you always forget to bring your water bottle and you're like, oh, there's nothing

286
00:17:41.028 --> 00:17:44.366
ever and there's never anything to drink there that's enough friction to get you to

287
00:17:44.388 --> 00:17:48.138
quit in the beginning. Yeah. So starting with something simple, life.

288
00:17:48.244 --> 00:17:50.498
All I'm going to do is I'm going to show up and I'm going to

289
00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:53.300
do one exercise for five minutes and then I'm going to go.

290
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.778
That, I think, is a good way to start. And it reminds me of

291
00:17:57.864 --> 00:18:01.206
what Steven Pressfield wrote. I think it was in The War of Art, where he

292
00:18:01.228 --> 00:18:04.326
said something to the effect of, like, if you sit down each day at the

293
00:18:04.348 --> 00:18:08.098
computer and you do your writing, at some point, at first it feels

294
00:18:08.114 --> 00:18:11.882
uncomfortable, but at some point that becomes your territory. And I really

295
00:18:11.936 --> 00:18:15.786
like that phrasing of it, because for an animal, for a wolf or

296
00:18:15.808 --> 00:18:19.370
something, a piece of land does not become

297
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.258
their territory unless they spend time in it. Right. Unless they

298
00:18:23.264 --> 00:18:26.926
are there each day. Yeah. It has to become comfortable first. And

299
00:18:26.948 --> 00:18:30.686
so for many people, building habits, whether that's getting into the

300
00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:33.694
gym or going to the yoga studio or sitting your butt in the chair and

301
00:18:33.732 --> 00:18:37.554
writing, you need to make that space your territory. And that

302
00:18:37.592 --> 00:18:40.974
the very first step is not getting a result, it's

303
00:18:41.022 --> 00:18:44.610
spending time there. It's making that little bit of land

304
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.580
a zone where you feel like, this is where I belong each day. Yeah.

305
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.806
And that's a big emotional hurdle to cross before you

306
00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:56.518
even worry about any of the physical or actual technical things to

307
00:18:56.524 --> 00:19:00.346
do. Yeah. And I mean, the other thing that helped is I

308
00:19:00.368 --> 00:19:04.202
went with my life. And it's funny because

309
00:19:04.336 --> 00:19:07.180
I felt I'm like,

310
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.786
Mr. Confident, but she was like at one point she's like, justin, you

311
00:19:11.808 --> 00:19:15.374
are so nervous right now. She could tell how

312
00:19:15.412 --> 00:19:18.800
nervous I was. And I thought I was like, keeping it all together

313
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.006
and it just reminded me of like, I'd been in

314
00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:26.786
gyms from the time I was in grade nine all the way through college. It

315
00:19:26.808 --> 00:19:29.890
wasn't like it was unfamiliar, but I was nervous

316
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.354
because it was unfamiliar. There had been a seven year gap and

317
00:19:34.392 --> 00:19:38.134
now I was like, exploring this again, worried about

318
00:19:38.172 --> 00:19:41.926
what these people are thinking about me. Wow, that guy looks like he is way

319
00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:45.720
more fit than me. All these thoughts go through your head

320
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.626
and so yeah, I think kind

321
00:19:49.648 --> 00:19:53.082
of figuring out how you can make a step

322
00:19:53.216 --> 00:19:56.842
and sometimes maybe it's like going with somebody so your at least have

323
00:19:56.896 --> 00:20:00.746
some emotional because it's emotional. It's nice to

324
00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:04.462
have someone to kind of share the emotional burden, right?

325
00:20:04.596 --> 00:20:07.760
For sure. Well, if you come the thing that

326
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.158
ultimately what you're looking to do is, like we just said, feel like it's part

327
00:20:12.164 --> 00:20:15.710
of your territory. And because there are other people in that space,

328
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.278
what that also means is you're looking to feel like you're part of the tribe

329
00:20:19.374 --> 00:20:23.026
who goes there right, that you belong with the other people who are in that

330
00:20:23.048 --> 00:20:26.674
room. It helps to

331
00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:29.734
what is a tribe? Well, it's a group of people that you get along with,

332
00:20:29.772 --> 00:20:33.414
that you bond with, that you belong to over something else, over

333
00:20:33.452 --> 00:20:37.126
some shared interest. And in other words, it's a group in a lot of

334
00:20:37.148 --> 00:20:40.934
ways of friends, friends who share some kind of interest. So these are your gym

335
00:20:40.982 --> 00:20:44.234
friends. Well, if you go with your wife, then you

336
00:20:44.272 --> 00:20:48.122
automatically have at least one person in the tribe that you are friends

337
00:20:48.176 --> 00:20:51.834
with that you do belong with. And so I think that helps you

338
00:20:51.872 --> 00:20:55.486
get over that hurdle a little bit. You're no longer facing that

339
00:20:55.508 --> 00:20:59.294
challenge alone. Before it was like, I am trying to get

340
00:20:59.332 --> 00:21:02.880
fit. Now it is we are trying to get fit. And

341
00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.058
that helps a lot with kind of the mental feeling of like, do I

342
00:21:07.064 --> 00:21:10.798
belong or not? Yeah, I've also found sorry, I don't

343
00:21:10.814 --> 00:21:14.500
mean to stay on this too long, but it's so fresh. That

344
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.806
the other thing I found myself doing because I'm interested in

345
00:21:18.828 --> 00:21:22.342
the emotional friction behind habits. And so

346
00:21:22.476 --> 00:21:25.320
the other thing I was doing is I was going in there

347
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.530
and I'm uncomfortable, so I'm trying to act really

348
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.338
tough, but I'm not tough at all. But

349
00:21:33.504 --> 00:21:37.242
when people look at me, I'm kind of like scowling. I'm not being

350
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:40.540
friendly. I'm not being myself. And

351
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.046
I was thinking about that and thinking, like when you're kind of

352
00:21:46.068 --> 00:21:49.806
inward focused and you're in a new environment and you're trying to

353
00:21:49.828 --> 00:21:52.190
develop a new habit, but you're inward focused,

354
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.506
it doesn't really help. And so I had to kind of turn that around and

355
00:21:57.528 --> 00:22:00.306
go, okay, I got to start being friendly. I got to start saying hi to

356
00:22:00.328 --> 00:22:04.174
these people because if I wave at this person and it feels

357
00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:08.034
good, like they respond with a smile and that

358
00:22:08.072 --> 00:22:11.846
happens again next time and again next time, that's a little bit of

359
00:22:11.868 --> 00:22:15.606
a reward for me. That's going to keep me going to the gym. But

360
00:22:15.628 --> 00:22:19.180
if I keep going here with this tough scowl on my face

361
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.154
and it's hard because you

362
00:22:24.192 --> 00:22:27.898
feel like you don't belong, you feel nervous and you kind

363
00:22:27.904 --> 00:22:30.890
of default to these weird behaviors.

364
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.238
And it took a little bit of time, but I realized, okay, now I got

365
00:22:36.244 --> 00:22:39.966
to get in the habit of smiling and

366
00:22:39.988 --> 00:22:43.662
saying hello when I'm in the gym, not just being in my own

367
00:22:43.716 --> 00:22:47.430
zone and pretending I'm somebody I'm not, right? Well, that's

368
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.738
one thing that kind of helps you start to belong or become part of the

369
00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:54.354
rest of the like, just a friendly behavior helps you start to

370
00:22:54.392 --> 00:22:58.146
develop friendships with some of those other people that are there. There was a

371
00:22:58.168 --> 00:23:01.926
study that I wanted to cite in Atomic Habits but I couldn't find it to

372
00:23:01.948 --> 00:23:05.334
track it down. But I read about it years ago where the

373
00:23:05.372 --> 00:23:09.094
YMCA ran a survey. And when they surveyed people

374
00:23:09.132 --> 00:23:12.454
who were joining the gym the thing that got them to join

375
00:23:12.582 --> 00:23:16.298
were the different classes offered the equipment that was in the

376
00:23:16.304 --> 00:23:20.138
gym. Basically, facilities and features were the things that got people in for the

377
00:23:20.144 --> 00:23:23.886
first time. But then when they surveyed members who had been there for over a

378
00:23:23.908 --> 00:23:27.566
year, the thing that got people to stick nobody mentioned features or

379
00:23:27.588 --> 00:23:31.422
facilities. Everybody mentioned friendships. And so the people

380
00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:35.098
who actually stayed at the gym or kept their membership were the ones who ended

381
00:23:35.114 --> 00:23:38.702
up developing friendships with other people there. And I think you're right.

382
00:23:38.756 --> 00:23:42.002
Ultimately, the thing that gets you to come back is like do I enjoy coming

383
00:23:42.056 --> 00:23:44.674
here? Does it mean I get to see some of my friends? Does it mean

384
00:23:44.712 --> 00:23:48.454
I get to hang out with people I like? Or it's really the sense

385
00:23:48.492 --> 00:23:52.040
of belonging that gets habits to stick and

386
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.198
the action itself is just kind of like something that's happening along the way.

387
00:23:56.284 --> 00:24:00.010
Yes, but there's a step before that that we kind of skipped over,

388
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.514
which is how do you even choose a habit in the first

389
00:24:03.552 --> 00:24:07.370
place? How does that happen in the sense of

390
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.980
I might not know what's good for me?

391
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.294
So how does that come into this?

392
00:24:15.492 --> 00:24:18.766
Yeah, well, there are a lot of ways to answer that question. So I'll just

393
00:24:18.788 --> 00:24:22.606
share a couple thoughts that come to mind. So the first thought that comes

394
00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:26.078
to mind is this question from I first heard from Seth Godin, which I think

395
00:24:26.084 --> 00:24:29.842
is just a great question, which is what is it for? And so

396
00:24:29.896 --> 00:24:32.514
this is a question that we need to ask ourselves when we're trying to build

397
00:24:32.552 --> 00:24:36.386
a new habit, which is what is this habit for? What am I actually trying

398
00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:40.022
to achieve here? Because the correct habit to choose is

399
00:24:40.076 --> 00:24:43.894
very different based on what your goals are, what you're hoping to get

400
00:24:43.932 --> 00:24:46.360
as an outcome, what kind of lifestyle you want.

401
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:52.378
For example, the habit of making 20 sales calls a day. Well,

402
00:24:52.464 --> 00:24:56.058
if what it's for is to increase revenue and to build a

403
00:24:56.064 --> 00:24:59.658
successful business, that's a wonderful thing. If you

404
00:24:59.744 --> 00:25:03.406
hate making sales calls and you want to spend less time working and more time

405
00:25:03.428 --> 00:25:06.894
with your family that could be a terrible habit to build. It just depends on

406
00:25:06.932 --> 00:25:10.574
what it's for. So that's one

407
00:25:10.612 --> 00:25:14.106
question to ask. But you are correct that we often don't

408
00:25:14.138 --> 00:25:17.826
know what we need in the moment. And I

409
00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:20.514
think part of that is just a challenge of life and a challenge of self

410
00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:24.386
awareness and knowing what you need. But life is

411
00:25:24.408 --> 00:25:28.226
a very complex system and so figuring out the right thing

412
00:25:28.248 --> 00:25:31.926
for that is sometimes it's just impossible. There are too many moving parts. Yeah.

413
00:25:32.028 --> 00:25:35.558
So I tend to default to two

414
00:25:35.644 --> 00:25:39.398
possible answers. The first answer is we all need things

415
00:25:39.484 --> 00:25:43.194
that are so boring that we don't think about them, but are incredibly important for

416
00:25:43.232 --> 00:25:46.906
showing up each day. So did you sleep 8 hours? Are

417
00:25:46.928 --> 00:25:50.746
you drinking enough water? Are you spending a little bit of time walking outside or

418
00:25:50.768 --> 00:25:54.330
getting a little bit of sunlight? Do you exercise consistently?

419
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.902
Whatever form is interesting to you? Are you spending some time

420
00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:01.294
reading and soaking up new ideas? I'm not saying you have to do all that

421
00:26:01.332 --> 00:26:04.542
stuff every day, but my point is those are things

422
00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:08.306
that most people would be like, yeah, of course you should sleep and read more

423
00:26:08.328 --> 00:26:12.114
books and exercise. Everybody knows that's good. But your time is

424
00:26:12.152 --> 00:26:15.634
almost never going to be wasted by making sure you do one of those

425
00:26:15.672 --> 00:26:19.414
things right. It's a fundamental that's worth spending time on,

426
00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:23.174
that's worth coming back to, that's worth reminding yourself of, even if you

427
00:26:23.212 --> 00:26:26.630
aren't sure the ideal, perfect place to focus in your life.

428
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.394
So that's the first answer. Come back to the fundamentals. The

429
00:26:30.432 --> 00:26:34.166
second answer is more broad. I can't

430
00:26:34.198 --> 00:26:37.622
be specific with it because it depends on each person. But the broad

431
00:26:37.686 --> 00:26:41.126
application is what I would call broad funnel, tight

432
00:26:41.158 --> 00:26:44.494
filter. So whenever you're trying to figure out where to

433
00:26:44.532 --> 00:26:48.254
focus, you need a really broad range of research. Try to get

434
00:26:48.292 --> 00:26:51.854
as many options as possible, then apply a

435
00:26:51.892 --> 00:26:55.498
really tight, strict filter to it and just focus on the one or

436
00:26:55.524 --> 00:26:59.140
two best options that you found. Okay, so for example,

437
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.586
I just finished Atomic Habits a few months ago. So now I'm thinking, should

438
00:27:03.608 --> 00:27:06.500
I write a second book? If I should, what should that be about?

439
00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.726
And I don't know right now. So I'm in the broad funnel stage, so I

440
00:27:10.748 --> 00:27:14.102
want to lay out as many options as possible. I want to brainstorm 1000

441
00:27:14.156 --> 00:27:17.734
titles. I want to look at all the top books on Amazon. I want to

442
00:27:17.772 --> 00:27:21.414
browse my best performing tweets and see if there's a possible thread for a book

443
00:27:21.452 --> 00:27:24.858
idea in there. I want to look everywhere I can and just list all of

444
00:27:24.864 --> 00:27:28.598
that stuff in the same spreadsheet. And maybe I got 1200 ideas

445
00:27:28.614 --> 00:27:32.378
on there really broad funnel. But then I need to apply a

446
00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:36.206
very tight filter. Is this something I'm interested in enough to spend two or

447
00:27:36.228 --> 00:27:39.674
three or four years working on? Is it a topic of broad

448
00:27:39.722 --> 00:27:42.526
appeal to a general audience? Are there going to be a lot of people that

449
00:27:42.548 --> 00:27:46.174
like this? Is this something that people that I can

450
00:27:46.212 --> 00:27:49.854
actually turn into something actionable? Can people use this in their daily

451
00:27:49.902 --> 00:27:53.618
life? Is this a topic that has a lot of stories that I

452
00:27:53.624 --> 00:27:57.346
could tell? Right? Can I actually make this entertaining or latch on

453
00:27:57.368 --> 00:28:01.174
to other interesting stories to make the book readable? Yes. And those

454
00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:04.966
are just some of the. Filters. But my point is that you want some

455
00:28:04.988 --> 00:28:08.566
period of very broad exploration, and then once you have a lot of options,

456
00:28:08.668 --> 00:28:12.194
you want to really tighten it down. Based on that question, what is this

457
00:28:12.252 --> 00:28:15.914
for? So in my case, the question I'm using is, well, it's for

458
00:28:16.032 --> 00:28:19.622
writing a good book, one that's highly actionable, one that sells a lot of copies,

459
00:28:19.686 --> 00:28:23.386
one that people find useful and so on. Yeah. So I think

460
00:28:23.408 --> 00:28:27.166
if you combine that broad funnel type filter strategy and that question of

461
00:28:27.188 --> 00:28:30.730
what is it for? That can maybe give you some more specific answers.

462
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:33.762
But even if you don't come up with something good there, you can always focus

463
00:28:33.816 --> 00:28:37.586
on the fundamentals. Yeah. And the other thing, when you

464
00:28:37.608 --> 00:28:41.154
mentioned Seth, godin, he has this other line

465
00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:44.740
which is people like us do things like this.

466
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.966
I love that line. I wish I had thought it up. But yeah, it's so

467
00:28:48.988 --> 00:28:52.706
good. It's such a great mantra. And what's

468
00:28:52.738 --> 00:28:56.102
interesting about it is, for

469
00:28:56.156 --> 00:28:59.802
me, one thing that made me start thinking

470
00:28:59.856 --> 00:29:03.642
about healthy habits was hanging out with people

471
00:29:03.696 --> 00:29:07.434
who had healthy habits. And in some

472
00:29:07.472 --> 00:29:11.210
ways, it was really lucky and fortunate.

473
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.546
Like, you guys invited me to that retreat. You did?

474
00:29:17.728 --> 00:29:21.486
Yes. And in some ways, I'm thankful you guys invited a loser like

475
00:29:21.508 --> 00:29:24.980
me, because I was, like, hanging out in that group.

476
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.770
I came, and at first I was cynical and grumpy,

477
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.514
and eventually, just looking around that group, I realized, man,

478
00:29:34.552 --> 00:29:37.800
these people like this do things like this.

479
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:42.182
And my cynicism, which before would have been like, wow,

480
00:29:42.236 --> 00:29:45.622
people like that do stuff like that. It went

481
00:29:45.676 --> 00:29:49.514
down. And then all of a sudden, I was like, okay, well, if people

482
00:29:49.552 --> 00:29:53.340
like this do things like this, that's what I need to do.

483
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:57.594
And I think for folks that are

484
00:29:57.792 --> 00:30:01.406
thinking like, okay, well, how do I know what good habits are? There

485
00:30:01.428 --> 00:30:05.262
are so many things that I would have

486
00:30:05.316 --> 00:30:07.120
never been

487
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:13.166
what do you call it there's the stages of habits or whatever, but I would

488
00:30:13.188 --> 00:30:16.914
have never even had the cue if I had not first observed it

489
00:30:16.952 --> 00:30:20.674
and then noticed, like, oh, wait, they're doing that, they're doing that, they're doing that.

490
00:30:20.872 --> 00:30:24.622
I'm the odd man out. And that's what motivated

491
00:30:24.686 --> 00:30:28.214
me to want to pursue some of that stuff.

492
00:30:28.332 --> 00:30:31.830
But if I hadn't been in that group and felt like, wait a second,

493
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.686
if I want to belong here, I got to

494
00:30:35.708 --> 00:30:39.238
up my game, right? It would have never happened.

495
00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:43.114
And so people like us do things like this has been really

496
00:30:43.152 --> 00:30:46.778
helpful for me. Yeah, I love that phrase. And one of the

497
00:30:46.784 --> 00:30:49.578
reasons I said that, oh, I wish I had thought that up is because I

498
00:30:49.584 --> 00:30:53.086
think it applies so deeply to a lot of the ideas in

499
00:30:53.108 --> 00:30:56.942
atomic habits. It applies to how

500
00:30:56.996 --> 00:31:00.846
socially reinforced our habits are. I think this is I wrote about

501
00:31:00.868 --> 00:31:03.314
this in the book. I mean, I have a whole chapter on it. Chapter nine

502
00:31:03.352 --> 00:31:07.118
is all about that. But I think I still undersold

503
00:31:07.214 --> 00:31:10.340
the importance of how socially reinforced our habits are.

504
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.706
And then it also references the importance of a

505
00:31:14.728 --> 00:31:18.226
shared identity. I think that ultimately a shared

506
00:31:18.258 --> 00:31:21.686
identity is really one of the most powerful forces for getting habits to

507
00:31:21.708 --> 00:31:25.446
stick. If you look at

508
00:31:25.468 --> 00:31:28.330
it in a big way, you can look at, like, religions.

509
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:33.194
Religions are really interesting places to look for habits. People get

510
00:31:33.232 --> 00:31:36.538
in the habit of going to church every Sunday for

511
00:31:36.704 --> 00:31:40.326
50 years, largely because it's reinforced

512
00:31:40.438 --> 00:31:44.122
the other people in their neighborhoods go. The people on their block

513
00:31:44.266 --> 00:31:47.662
go. They see their friends there. It's a very

514
00:31:47.716 --> 00:31:51.326
socially reinforced habit. Same thing is true

515
00:31:51.428 --> 00:31:54.942
in smaller ways. Like, let's say you move into a new house and you walk

516
00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:58.546
outside on Tuesday night and you see all your neighbors have their

517
00:31:58.568 --> 00:32:02.306
recycling bins out, and you're like, people like us do things like

518
00:32:02.328 --> 00:32:06.146
this. Like, people who live in this neighborhood recycle on Tuesday nights. I guess

519
00:32:06.168 --> 00:32:09.782
we need to sign up for recycling. And there are really

520
00:32:09.836 --> 00:32:13.542
almost an infinite range of examples that are like that, both large and

521
00:32:13.596 --> 00:32:17.414
small, where our habits are. We notice them

522
00:32:17.452 --> 00:32:20.826
because the people around us are doing them, which is what the cue portion is

523
00:32:20.848 --> 00:32:24.614
you referenced. We desire to do them. We crave

524
00:32:24.662 --> 00:32:28.442
to follow through on them because by doing the same, we fit in

525
00:32:28.496 --> 00:32:31.990
or signal to the other people around us, hey, I get it. I'm part of

526
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.838
the tribe too. It becomes easier to do it

527
00:32:35.924 --> 00:32:39.726
because sometimes you have friends helping you out. It's like having a

528
00:32:39.748 --> 00:32:43.566
spotter at the gym. Like, oh, people like us help each other out when

529
00:32:43.588 --> 00:32:46.654
a set is hard. And then ultimately it becomes

530
00:32:46.702 --> 00:32:50.354
satisfying because you enjoy being praised for

531
00:32:50.392 --> 00:32:53.346
it. Other people are like, hey, it was great to see you at church on

532
00:32:53.368 --> 00:32:56.520
Sunday, or, really good job on that workout today.

533
00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.546
And that feels good to be praised for fitting

534
00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:03.794
in. And so in that way, socially

535
00:33:03.842 --> 00:33:07.554
reinforced habits or the collective

536
00:33:07.602 --> 00:33:10.806
identity, it hits all four stages of habit

537
00:33:10.838 --> 00:33:14.682
formation. And I knew

538
00:33:14.736 --> 00:33:17.610
that when I was writing it, but I don't think I gave it as much

539
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.406
importance as I should have. It's a very powerful driver of behavior in the long

540
00:33:21.428 --> 00:33:24.446
run. Yeah, totally. And I think this is why

541
00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:28.270
cynicism is such a toxic

542
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.680
attitude. And

543
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:37.166
I guess I'm in Gen X. I'm born in 1980. There's

544
00:33:37.198 --> 00:33:40.946
a lot of cynicism in Gen X. And then millennials also have

545
00:33:40.968 --> 00:33:44.706
a little bit of this too. And

546
00:33:44.728 --> 00:33:48.518
actually, to be honest, everybody has it. Baby boomers have it. When if you're a

547
00:33:48.524 --> 00:33:52.134
50 year old programmer and you get hired at a

548
00:33:52.252 --> 00:33:56.006
startup where the CEO is 20 years old, we kind

549
00:33:56.028 --> 00:33:58.410
of default to cynicism.

550
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.794
And it's such a blocker when

551
00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:06.666
you're trying to observe those norms, like, oh, wait, people like

552
00:34:06.688 --> 00:34:10.374
us do things like this. Cynicism allows you to go, well, yeah,

553
00:34:10.512 --> 00:34:14.286
people like that do stuff like that. That's good for them, that's good for

554
00:34:14.308 --> 00:34:18.046
James Clear, but that's not good for

555
00:34:18.068 --> 00:34:21.600
me. And what I'm trying to

556
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.746
kind of reveal from my experience for

557
00:34:25.768 --> 00:34:29.506
anyone that ever watches this or listens to this is that you really do need

558
00:34:29.528 --> 00:34:33.314
to step outside that and at least be open

559
00:34:33.432 --> 00:34:37.074
to this idea that your life could get

560
00:34:37.112 --> 00:34:40.520
better, and it could just be going. Okay, well,

561
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.598
I'm going to vote for who I'm going to be today, and I'm going to

562
00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:48.166
vote for who I'm going to be tomorrow, and I'm going to keep going. The

563
00:34:48.188 --> 00:34:51.506
other thing in the book that really helped me, and I'm probably going to butcher

564
00:34:51.538 --> 00:34:55.302
it. So you clean up after I do it, but you show this grid.

565
00:34:55.446 --> 00:34:59.146
So imagine, like, on this side of your day, it's like, okay, I

566
00:34:59.168 --> 00:35:02.686
make a good decision, so it goes up, and then I make another good

567
00:35:02.708 --> 00:35:06.446
decision goes up, but then I make a bad decision. Like, I eat a

568
00:35:06.468 --> 00:35:10.266
tub of ice cream, and sometimes eating the tub

569
00:35:10.298 --> 00:35:14.062
of ice cream is like, debilitating. It's like,

570
00:35:14.116 --> 00:35:17.646
well, I'm done. I ate the tub of ice cream.

571
00:35:17.758 --> 00:35:21.234
I suck at this. I'm just going to go get into bed and forget about

572
00:35:21.272 --> 00:35:24.834
it. And in your grid, you show, wait, but you're still up

573
00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:28.646
here. You can just make another good decision, and

574
00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:32.134
then you're back up again. And I like that idea of kind of

575
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:36.006
navigating your ideas, not being so hard on ourselves. Did

576
00:35:36.028 --> 00:35:38.440
I kind of get that right? Yeah.

577
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.500
I don't know if you can see it, but this is the image. But

578
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.274
it's this idea that the difference between a good day and a bad day is

579
00:35:49.312 --> 00:35:52.782
often just a series of choices, right. And you can win each little

580
00:35:52.836 --> 00:35:56.558
moment, right? You can win each decisive moment. Just because you ate the

581
00:35:56.564 --> 00:35:59.600
tub of ice cream doesn't mean you can't win the next moment. Yes.

582
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.938
One thing that I was thinking about when I wrote that is this concept that

583
00:36:05.944 --> 00:36:09.726
I call decisive moments, this idea that there are a few choices

584
00:36:09.758 --> 00:36:13.554
each day, maybe somewhere between, say, five and ten, that kind of

585
00:36:13.592 --> 00:36:17.358
determine the next chunk of time. For example, there's

586
00:36:17.374 --> 00:36:20.902
a moment for me each morning where I sit down and

587
00:36:20.956 --> 00:36:24.738
either I open up Evernote and I start writing the next article I'm

588
00:36:24.754 --> 00:36:28.594
going to work on, or I go to ESPN and I check the latest sports

589
00:36:28.642 --> 00:36:32.346
news. Yeah. And what happens in the next hour

590
00:36:32.448 --> 00:36:36.250
is really determined by what happens in the first 45 seconds.

591
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:40.474
Do I go to Evernote or do I go to ESPN? So

592
00:36:40.512 --> 00:36:44.174
that is a decisive moment in my language. That's like a moment that

593
00:36:44.212 --> 00:36:47.886
determines if I can master those 45 seconds, then I can end up

594
00:36:47.908 --> 00:36:51.360
mastering the next your that comes afterward almost automatically. Yeah,

595
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:55.646
same thing is true. There's a moment each night, like 515 or so my wife

596
00:36:55.678 --> 00:36:59.454
gets home from work and either we change into our workout clothes

597
00:36:59.582 --> 00:37:03.186
or we sit on the couch and watch reruns the office and

598
00:37:03.208 --> 00:37:06.834
order Indian food or whatever. And both of those nights are good

599
00:37:06.872 --> 00:37:10.434
nights. But the moment to master is do we change into our

600
00:37:10.472 --> 00:37:14.262
workout clothes or not? If we do that, it only takes a few minutes. Everything

601
00:37:14.316 --> 00:37:17.218
else for the next 2 hours is already decided. We'll get in the car, we'll

602
00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:21.066
drive to the gym, we'll do the reps. It's all pretty much done at that

603
00:37:21.088 --> 00:37:24.922
point. Yeah. So the reason I like bringing that up or like thinking

604
00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:28.730
about that is you start to realize there really

605
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.634
isn't that much that you need to master. Really. You just are

606
00:37:32.672 --> 00:37:36.426
trying to focus your attention on a few key decisive

607
00:37:36.458 --> 00:37:39.934
moments throughout the day. It's kind of like applying judo to your

608
00:37:39.972 --> 00:37:43.758
life. It's like apply the pressure and the leverage at just the right point

609
00:37:43.844 --> 00:37:47.060
and then the next hour kind of falls into place automatically. Yeah.

610
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:51.294
And so I like that because once you realize that once you kind of identify

611
00:37:51.342 --> 00:37:54.594
those high leverage decision points, you can

612
00:37:54.712 --> 00:37:58.550
organize your day and your environment around

613
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.406
those things. If I know that those 45 seconds where I'm

614
00:38:02.428 --> 00:38:05.830
choosing between Evernote or ESPN is a real key moment,

615
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.074
well, I could install freedom and then I could block

616
00:38:09.122 --> 00:38:12.954
ESPN from 08:00 A.m. To 10:00 A.m. And that

617
00:38:12.992 --> 00:38:16.234
takes care of that decisive moment and it increases the odds that I'm going to

618
00:38:16.272 --> 00:38:19.834
open a note instead. But anyway, so little

619
00:38:19.872 --> 00:38:23.534
choices like that are easier to make once you've identified some of those key

620
00:38:23.572 --> 00:38:27.114
points of leverage. Yeah. And you talk in the book life, there's some tricks

621
00:38:27.162 --> 00:38:30.590
too, where you can make things automatic.

622
00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:35.490
Like you talk about near a, y'all, buying

623
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.266
a little device that just shuts off his internet every night at ten.

624
00:38:39.448 --> 00:38:42.962
Outlet timer. Yeah. And what's brilliant about that

625
00:38:43.016 --> 00:38:46.806
is it shuts it off, especially if it's in the basement or

626
00:38:46.828 --> 00:38:50.310
whatever, you're not going to go downstairs and fiddle around with it

627
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.782
and then that's what happens.

628
00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:57.586
Right. If ESPN was really killing

629
00:38:57.618 --> 00:39:01.418
you, you could just cancel your cable subscription. That might be a

630
00:39:01.424 --> 00:39:05.014
bit but then you go to watch ESPN. You can't

631
00:39:05.062 --> 00:39:08.746
right. It's done. By the way,

632
00:39:08.848 --> 00:39:12.650
you mentioned this in the book too. But it's so funny how certain people's,

633
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.086
what is a trigger for some people is not for others. Like ESPN for

634
00:39:17.108 --> 00:39:20.654
me is not a, that's not a temptation at

635
00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:24.446
all. Yeah, it doesn't even enter your worldview. Doesn't enter my worldview. But

636
00:39:24.468 --> 00:39:28.226
it shows you how identity is so much a part of this. Like if I

637
00:39:28.248 --> 00:39:31.730
was hanging out with a bunch of Oilers fans every single day

638
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.682
and this happened in the office, there's a few people

639
00:39:35.736 --> 00:39:39.554
and they're watching know on, on their

640
00:39:39.592 --> 00:39:43.366
computers and I realize like if I want to talk to them, I've got

641
00:39:43.388 --> 00:39:47.174
to start watching. Yeah. So people like us do things like this.

642
00:39:47.292 --> 00:39:51.098
And so I started developing this habit of watching Oilers games when

643
00:39:51.264 --> 00:39:54.826
before I. Didn'T even mean I think this is one of the

644
00:39:54.848 --> 00:39:58.602
reasons why sports is so tribal, why people get so emotional about it,

645
00:39:58.656 --> 00:40:01.946
is that it becomes a connection point for the

646
00:40:01.968 --> 00:40:05.774
relationships. The game is actually no one would ever

647
00:40:05.812 --> 00:40:08.606
say that because everybody acts like the game is the thing that matters the most.

648
00:40:08.708 --> 00:40:12.000
But in a weird way, it's kind of a secondary thing, really,

649
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.174
when I think back. For me, sports is a way for my

650
00:40:16.212 --> 00:40:19.426
brother and I to connect and for us to have something to text about and

651
00:40:19.448 --> 00:40:23.198
chat about throughout the week. It's a thing that it's a reason for my dad

652
00:40:23.214 --> 00:40:26.114
and I to get together in person and to go to games and hang out,

653
00:40:26.152 --> 00:40:29.734
and it's all the other stuff that it provides that

654
00:40:29.772 --> 00:40:33.606
makes it so deeply meaningful. And then

655
00:40:33.788 --> 00:40:36.598
you end up assigning a lot of that emotion to how the team does on

656
00:40:36.604 --> 00:40:39.000
the field as well. What the score is on the

657
00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:44.246
yeah. It'S a good example there on that topic, then. And this is Corey

658
00:40:44.278 --> 00:40:47.354
Stone is asking this in chat, but there's a lot of people on Twitter that

659
00:40:47.392 --> 00:40:51.120
ask this too. Given that example that you just gave,

660
00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.942
if your meaningful relationships are

661
00:40:54.996 --> 00:40:58.686
engaging in habits that might not be good for you or that you want to

662
00:40:58.708 --> 00:41:02.286
change, how do you navigate that? So if

663
00:41:02.308 --> 00:41:05.874
you're really feeling like, I got to stop

664
00:41:05.912 --> 00:41:09.650
watching sports, it's just like, I get a little bit and then I just go

665
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.426
crazy. But I still want to have a relationship with

666
00:41:13.448 --> 00:41:17.186
my brother. This is where it gets complex, especially if your married

667
00:41:17.218 --> 00:41:20.946
to somebody, your wife

668
00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:24.226
is at least somewhat inclined to want to go to the gym, I'm

669
00:41:24.258 --> 00:41:27.958
guessing. But if she was like, no, I just want to watch Netflix and

670
00:41:27.964 --> 00:41:31.626
order Indian food, that's all I want to yeah. How do you start to

671
00:41:31.648 --> 00:41:34.700
navigate those things? Yeah, those are good questions.

672
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:39.386
I mean, it's really hard because especially if it's a

673
00:41:39.408 --> 00:41:43.146
person who you want to stay in, your know, I think first of all, I

674
00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:45.486
just want to say so I have some things I want to add to this,

675
00:41:45.508 --> 00:41:49.118
but I feel like it's worth noting that

676
00:41:49.284 --> 00:41:53.086
this question comes up a lot. And I think the reason it comes up

677
00:41:53.108 --> 00:41:56.954
a lot is because we all know that actually there isn't

678
00:41:57.002 --> 00:42:00.418
a good easy answer and that it's just a hard part of life. You know

679
00:42:00.424 --> 00:42:03.938
what I mean? It's one of those things we want to keep asking

680
00:42:04.024 --> 00:42:07.630
about in hopes that, oh, maybe there'll be an easy way to resolve this. But

681
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.680
I think we all know it's a challenge. Yeah.

682
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.534
Now, that said, there are a few things you can do. So first thing

683
00:42:14.572 --> 00:42:18.198
is sometimes your friends and family want to do something

684
00:42:18.284 --> 00:42:22.086
different than how you want to change. So, like, you want to stick

685
00:42:22.118 --> 00:42:25.754
to a new diet, they want to eat the old way or something

686
00:42:25.792 --> 00:42:29.526
like that. Well, you want to start doing yoga, they couldn't

687
00:42:29.558 --> 00:42:32.846
care less about yoga, they don't want to go to class with you, things like

688
00:42:32.868 --> 00:42:36.142
that. Well, if that's the case, then for certain

689
00:42:36.196 --> 00:42:39.998
habits you don't have to fire your friends and family to be

690
00:42:40.004 --> 00:42:43.726
able to do that. But what you do need, or what can

691
00:42:43.748 --> 00:42:47.282
be really useful is having a sacred space where that

692
00:42:47.336 --> 00:42:51.074
occurs. Where I'm not saying you need to do this with me, but

693
00:42:51.112 --> 00:42:54.818
just don't make it harder on me. Right. Just don't conflict with so

694
00:42:54.984 --> 00:42:58.718
the yoga example is an easier one where it's like, well, maybe you need to

695
00:42:58.744 --> 00:43:02.406
go to a yoga studio away from the friends and

696
00:43:02.428 --> 00:43:05.814
family that aren't interested and start to build friendships with people who

697
00:43:05.852 --> 00:43:08.854
are. I'm not saying you need to get rid of your old friends, but maybe

698
00:43:08.892 --> 00:43:11.866
it'd be helpful to build a couple of new ones who are into yoga so

699
00:43:11.888 --> 00:43:15.626
that you have a safe space for that habit to live. Yeah, so

700
00:43:15.648 --> 00:43:19.194
that's one thing. Then there's the second piece, which

701
00:43:19.232 --> 00:43:22.890
is sometimes you're building a habit that you do want

702
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.734
the person to join you on to come along with you. You're working

703
00:43:26.772 --> 00:43:30.014
out and you would love for your spouse to join your at the gym or

704
00:43:30.052 --> 00:43:33.886
something like that. And everybody knows it would be

705
00:43:33.908 --> 00:43:37.682
good, but maybe they feel less comfortable there than you do.

706
00:43:37.736 --> 00:43:41.566
Or maybe they feel you were previously an athlete

707
00:43:41.598 --> 00:43:45.118
and they were not. And so you feel kind of comfortable in the gym. You've

708
00:43:45.134 --> 00:43:48.898
been there before in years past. But for them it's like new and weird and

709
00:43:48.984 --> 00:43:52.678
they feel like they're being judged and whatever. If you're dealing with a

710
00:43:52.684 --> 00:43:56.374
case like that, the thing that I try to keep in mind,

711
00:43:56.412 --> 00:44:00.134
and I can tell you from working with my own family, it can be incredibly

712
00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:04.006
useful, is praise the good, ignore the bad. It's

713
00:44:04.038 --> 00:44:07.754
very hard to do. The difficult part about it is

714
00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:11.354
not doing it on an individual basis. It's that this needs to be the new

715
00:44:11.392 --> 00:44:15.102
lifestyle for you. So when they do the thing that you're asking

716
00:44:15.156 --> 00:44:18.702
them to do, basically another way to phrase this is

717
00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:22.000
don't criticize people for doing what you were hoping they would.

718
00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:26.366
There are so many times when the introverted kid in the family

719
00:44:26.468 --> 00:44:29.506
will come down to the dinner table and it's like, oh, look who decided to

720
00:44:29.528 --> 00:44:33.042
join us. And it's like, well they finally did the thing

721
00:44:33.176 --> 00:44:36.914
that your were hoping they would do and engage with everybody and

722
00:44:36.952 --> 00:44:39.880
now they just feel like they're getting criticized for it. Or

723
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:44.726
you go to the gym and your spouse decides to join you

724
00:44:44.828 --> 00:44:47.894
and they do a few sets and then they feel like they're done and you

725
00:44:47.932 --> 00:44:51.506
say, well, that was a pretty short workout when what you should

726
00:44:51.548 --> 00:44:55.386
be saying is I think it's great that you got in here tonight, right? Like

727
00:44:55.408 --> 00:44:58.300
you weren't feeling it, but you were still able to make it in. Yeah.

728
00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.974
So praise the good, ignore the bad, and if you can do

729
00:45:03.012 --> 00:45:06.174
that in the long run, what ends up happening is

730
00:45:06.372 --> 00:45:10.154
everybody likes feeling praised, everybody life feeling

731
00:45:10.202 --> 00:45:13.790
rewarded. It feels satisfying to

732
00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.486
do something that the people who love you and who are around you praise you

733
00:45:17.508 --> 00:45:21.314
for. And so at first you go to the gym and they say, hey,

734
00:45:21.352 --> 00:45:24.046
I'm really proud of you for getting in here tonight. Good job. And it doesn't

735
00:45:24.078 --> 00:45:27.714
seem like much, but then after two months and three months and ten

736
00:45:27.752 --> 00:45:31.510
months of that, you turn around a year later and they might never even

737
00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.286
say it, but implicitly, what they've realized is, damn, every

738
00:45:35.308 --> 00:45:38.840
time I go to the gym, it feels good, they compliment me.

739
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:43.174
Now all of a sudden, you start to associate going to the gym with feeling

740
00:45:43.222 --> 00:45:46.890
good. And this is a really long game play because

741
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.540
it takes a while for that to reinforce itself. But

742
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:55.102
same thing. Like the introverted kid at the table sits down and

743
00:45:55.236 --> 00:45:58.506
they say something that happened today and it's like, oh, that's awesome. Thanks for sharing

744
00:45:58.538 --> 00:46:02.366
that with us on that individual night. That one night at

745
00:46:02.388 --> 00:46:06.062
dinner doesn't count for a lot, but if every time they speak up

746
00:46:06.116 --> 00:46:09.874
they're rewarded for it, then all of a sudden now they have a reason

747
00:46:09.912 --> 00:46:13.586
to start doing that more in the months and years to come. So it

748
00:46:13.608 --> 00:46:17.214
takes a while, but I think that that's like an effective way to gradually

749
00:46:17.262 --> 00:46:21.046
nudge people in the right direction. Yeah, there's someone in the chat that's saying they

750
00:46:21.068 --> 00:46:24.774
need to apply that idea to themselves to avoid feeling guilty for not

751
00:46:24.812 --> 00:46:28.434
doing enough. So instead of reinforce, oh, you idiot,

752
00:46:28.482 --> 00:46:31.882
you didn't go to the gym again, you fatty. That's not

753
00:46:31.936 --> 00:46:35.626
helpful. The self talk can work with

754
00:46:35.648 --> 00:46:39.194
self talk as well. This is why I think small

755
00:46:39.232 --> 00:46:43.066
habits can be so useful in some ways, even on the bad days. Because

756
00:46:43.168 --> 00:46:47.006
let's say you're in that situation you just said, where it's like, oh, skip the

757
00:46:47.028 --> 00:46:50.814
gym again. Well, you can still do one push up or one air

758
00:46:50.852 --> 00:46:54.126
squat or whatever before you go do a set of ten air squats before you

759
00:46:54.148 --> 00:46:57.854
hop in bed tonight, and it's not going to transform

760
00:46:57.902 --> 00:47:01.426
your body. But that's not really the point. The point is to prove to

761
00:47:01.448 --> 00:47:05.166
yourself that it wasn't a good day. I didn't have the best motivation

762
00:47:05.198 --> 00:47:08.738
or energy. I had a long day at work, but I still am not the

763
00:47:08.744 --> 00:47:12.374
type of person who misses workouts, right? I still proved to myself

764
00:47:12.492 --> 00:47:15.958
I still cast a vote for being that kind of person. I didn't let a

765
00:47:15.964 --> 00:47:19.666
day go by without doing nothing. And that

766
00:47:19.708 --> 00:47:23.194
can count for a lot in the long run. And so sometimes small

767
00:47:23.232 --> 00:47:26.906
habits are less about the outcome they deliver and more about the

768
00:47:26.928 --> 00:47:30.380
identity they reinforce. Yeah. And I've actually found

769
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.634
another thing I'm

770
00:47:34.682 --> 00:47:38.394
implementing in the new year is I decided

771
00:47:38.442 --> 00:47:41.786
to quit drinking alcohol. And right now, it's

772
00:47:41.818 --> 00:47:45.106
ostensibly for this goal of hitting a revenue mark. Once I hit the

773
00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:48.734
goal, then I can have a drink. But the deeper

774
00:47:48.782 --> 00:47:51.410
motivation for me was I just realized

775
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.686
it's a depressant. There's a bunch of reasons that it's

776
00:47:56.718 --> 00:48:00.166
not good for me. And so my

777
00:48:00.268 --> 00:48:03.846
excuse or my way of trying it out is saying, well, I'm going for this

778
00:48:03.868 --> 00:48:07.606
goal, but it's been interesting in social situations because all

779
00:48:07.628 --> 00:48:11.340
my friends still drink, and that's fine with me. But

780
00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:16.634
sometimes just sharing the goal, oh, I'm just doing this because I'm going after this

781
00:48:16.672 --> 00:48:19.690
thing. And you talk about how goals are sometimes

782
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.646
helpful in setting your direction, like, okay,

783
00:48:23.668 --> 00:48:27.390
I'm pointed this way now, and sometimes

784
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.118
sharing that with people is helpful. The other thing is, I think eventually, if I

785
00:48:31.124 --> 00:48:34.870
just keep doing this, just for me to say, well, I'm a non

786
00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:38.514
drinker now. Yeah. And so I can still go

787
00:48:38.552 --> 00:48:42.354
and have my favorite. And it's also

788
00:48:42.392 --> 00:48:46.014
nice having a thing that you like. So my favorite non alcoholic

789
00:48:46.062 --> 00:48:49.666
drink is a non alcoholic Caesar. It's like a Bloody

790
00:48:49.698 --> 00:48:53.526
Mary. And to have that drink, it's, like, kind of

791
00:48:53.548 --> 00:48:57.174
spicy. There's a reward there. I also have

792
00:48:57.212 --> 00:49:00.060
this social crutch that I can use in a situation,

793
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.746
and if somebody asks me about it, I also have this new

794
00:49:04.768 --> 00:49:08.118
identity, which is, oh, I'm a non drinker now, I just don't

795
00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:11.966
drink. And you talked about that. There's some research behind that.

796
00:49:11.988 --> 00:49:15.546
I know you've mentioned it a lot, but it's like, I'm trying to quit

797
00:49:15.578 --> 00:49:18.926
smoking versus I'm a non smoker. Right. Is that

798
00:49:18.948 --> 00:49:22.506
correct? Correct. Yeah. So I

799
00:49:22.548 --> 00:49:25.220
think that can be really helpful. Yeah.

800
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:32.370
I think what you're explaining here, the situation that you're going through, this experience

801
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.254
you're having, is kind of it's illustrating this process of identity

802
00:49:36.302 --> 00:49:39.058
change. Right. It started with, oh, I'm just going to put it off for a

803
00:49:39.064 --> 00:49:42.786
little while while I'm attacking this goal. But then you're casting so many votes

804
00:49:42.818 --> 00:49:46.182
for like, you know what? I haven't drank, and I'm kind of benefiting from it.

805
00:49:46.236 --> 00:49:49.270
Maybe this is part of my identity now. Maybe I'm a non drinker

806
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:54.458
anyway. Yeah, I think you're definitely on the right track there. Yeah. And actually, this

807
00:49:54.464 --> 00:49:57.260
is a good time to bring up two Twitter questions.

808
00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.310
Maria Aldri asks,

809
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.578
how do your maintain habits? Ask him about maintaining

810
00:50:05.594 --> 00:50:09.338
habits for people with depression, anxiety, or attention deficit.

811
00:50:09.514 --> 00:50:12.880
Do you want to try to tackle that? Yeah.

812
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:17.166
So I've tried to be careful about saying that Atomic Habits

813
00:50:17.198 --> 00:50:20.930
is about building habits and breaking bad habits, building good ones.

814
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.258
But it's not a book on addiction. It's not a book on depression. It's not

815
00:50:24.264 --> 00:50:28.066
a book about anxiety or ADHD or any of these other disorders

816
00:50:28.098 --> 00:50:31.910
or ailments. And I don't consider myself

817
00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.654
an expert on addiction. However, something interesting has

818
00:50:35.692 --> 00:50:39.526
happened. So I published the book, and I have had a ton

819
00:50:39.548 --> 00:50:43.194
of speaking requests recently, and so I've been doing speeches at conferences and

820
00:50:43.232 --> 00:50:46.762
companies and different events and whatever. And so

821
00:50:46.816 --> 00:50:50.458
many times I get someone that comes up to me afterward or that asks a

822
00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:54.014
question during Q A that talks about how useful the book was

823
00:50:54.052 --> 00:50:57.754
for their son, who had ADHD or their cousin

824
00:50:57.802 --> 00:51:01.614
was a meth addict and then was able to start to write the Ship by

825
00:51:01.652 --> 00:51:05.374
employing some of these techniques or whatever. Yeah, which is great, which is very

826
00:51:05.412 --> 00:51:09.186
gratifying. I still stand by my original statement. I'm not an expert on

827
00:51:09.208 --> 00:51:12.866
addiction. I don't want to take a strong stance with this stuff. But what

828
00:51:12.888 --> 00:51:16.466
I've realized is that the principles that I lay out in

829
00:51:16.488 --> 00:51:20.070
Atomic Habits are really about how human behavior works.

830
00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:23.862
It's about how habits are formed and whether that habit is something

831
00:51:23.916 --> 00:51:27.618
extreme like an addiction or picking your skin or OCD

832
00:51:27.714 --> 00:51:31.562
or ADHD or whatever, or whether it's something more

833
00:51:31.616 --> 00:51:35.354
moderate like meditating for three minutes a day. Yes, the

834
00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:39.146
fundamentals tend to be similar. And so I'm not going to

835
00:51:39.168 --> 00:51:42.986
say that the book offers a prescription for overcoming addictions, but what

836
00:51:43.008 --> 00:51:46.686
I will say is you'd be hard pressed to find tactics in the book

837
00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:50.206
that wouldn't at least help, right? That wouldn't at least nudge people in the right

838
00:51:50.228 --> 00:51:54.074
direction. I have heard from a few readers

839
00:51:54.122 --> 00:51:57.710
who specifically have said that they had ADHD

840
00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:01.538
and that they found the book very helpful. Environment design,

841
00:52:01.624 --> 00:52:05.266
for whatever reason, has been something that's come up multiple times for folks who have

842
00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:08.966
struggled with that. So I think it's kind of like if

843
00:52:08.988 --> 00:52:12.774
you're the type of person who is less likely to just remember to do

844
00:52:12.812 --> 00:52:16.582
it or just follow your to do list. If that's not

845
00:52:16.636 --> 00:52:20.366
you, then structuring an environment where it's easier

846
00:52:20.418 --> 00:52:23.754
to see the cues of your good habits, less likely to see the

847
00:52:23.792 --> 00:52:27.510
distractions. Less friction between you and the good behavior.

848
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:31.402
More friction between you and the bad ones. If you place yourself in that

849
00:52:31.456 --> 00:52:35.086
space, it's much more likely that you're going to fall through. So

850
00:52:35.268 --> 00:52:39.006
those are things I talk about in chapters six and twelve, but I think

851
00:52:39.028 --> 00:52:42.846
that the book applies, but I don't pitch it as like a

852
00:52:42.868 --> 00:52:46.658
prescription for someone dealing with a more serious issue. Totally. Yeah. And I

853
00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:50.514
would say again, I'm not an expert either, but as someone who has

854
00:52:50.552 --> 00:52:54.180
been dealing with depression the past couple of years,

855
00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:00.854
having a professional that your go to that deals with this stuff all the time,

856
00:53:00.892 --> 00:53:04.440
like a therapist is so helpful, and

857
00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:08.566
the therapist will be very interested if

858
00:53:08.588 --> 00:53:12.374
you read James's book. So I said to my therapist, I'm like, your know, she

859
00:53:12.412 --> 00:53:16.186
starts way back here and then she says, so what's new

860
00:53:16.208 --> 00:53:19.258
with life? Well, you know, I read this book and I'm thinking, oh, what are

861
00:53:19.264 --> 00:53:22.400
you thinking about doing? With that. Oh, I'm thinking about maybe

862
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:26.366
quitting alcohol. Oh, well, there's some

863
00:53:26.388 --> 00:53:29.790
reinforcement from the professionals. And

864
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.762
likewise with my doctor when I

865
00:53:33.816 --> 00:53:37.202
had depression and I went to my physician, she

866
00:53:37.256 --> 00:53:39.810
said she gave me two prescriptions,

867
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:44.610
quit drinking alcohol and quit

868
00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:48.578
taking any kind of cannabis. And

869
00:53:48.744 --> 00:53:52.566
the reason is, she says, those are going to make you feel bad. Now,

870
00:53:52.588 --> 00:53:55.762
the trigger in that case was my doctor. It's nice when you have a doctor

871
00:53:55.826 --> 00:53:59.378
saying, listen, this is your prescription. Oh, and double the amount of exercise I was

872
00:53:59.404 --> 00:54:01.180
doing. So three things.

873
00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:06.986
So I did that for three months, and then I went back to my old

874
00:54:07.008 --> 00:54:10.574
habits. But now I have that memory of what it was like for three

875
00:54:10.612 --> 00:54:14.414
months. And it's been a powerful trigger for me to

876
00:54:14.612 --> 00:54:17.920
when I am starting to notice my mood go down.

877
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:22.282
I remembered my doctor's prescription was quit drinking,

878
00:54:22.426 --> 00:54:26.274
quit eating edibles, and doubling my

879
00:54:26.312 --> 00:54:30.066
exercise. And that's been helpful for me personally. So I think

880
00:54:30.088 --> 00:54:33.554
if you're reading the book, let your professional in your life know about

881
00:54:33.592 --> 00:54:37.382
it is good. One thing I want you to do

882
00:54:37.436 --> 00:54:41.094
is because I love the imagery and this is

883
00:54:41.132 --> 00:54:44.882
probably unfair to you, is to give the ice cube example, but use celsius

884
00:54:44.946 --> 00:54:46.230
instead of fahrenheit.

885
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:52.986
So this is an example from the first chapter of the

886
00:54:53.008 --> 00:54:56.794
book. And actually, as a side

887
00:54:56.832 --> 00:54:58.906
note, I thought about this. I was like, man, we're going to have to get

888
00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:02.174
these changed for the foreign editions. It's going to need to be. But

889
00:55:02.212 --> 00:55:02.800
anyway,

890
00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:09.966
the core idea is that the process of changing your habits is well,

891
00:55:09.988 --> 00:55:12.926
it's similar to what we talked about early on, that there's often this valley of

892
00:55:12.948 --> 00:55:16.554
death that there's this period where you're just kind of building

893
00:55:16.612 --> 00:55:19.886
up latent potential, but you're not really releasing any of the results

894
00:55:19.918 --> 00:55:23.698
yet. And I like to equate it to the process of heating up an

895
00:55:23.704 --> 00:55:27.378
ice cube. So you've got this ice cube sitting on a

896
00:55:27.384 --> 00:55:30.790
table, right? And so let's say it's like negative three degrees in there,

897
00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:34.646
right? So you're at negative three. It's cold, you can

898
00:55:34.668 --> 00:55:38.070
see your breath. The ice cube is sitting there. You heat it up. Negative two,

899
00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.754
negative one. Still there's. This ice cube sitting there. Nothing has

900
00:55:41.792 --> 00:55:45.322
happened, right? Then you go from negative one to zero,

901
00:55:45.456 --> 00:55:49.130
and all of a sudden you have this one degree shift, no different

902
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.846
than any of the other shifts that came before it, but you have this

903
00:55:52.868 --> 00:55:56.522
phase transition, right, and the ice cube starts melting.

904
00:55:56.666 --> 00:56:00.314
And that, I think, is indicative of what it often feels

905
00:56:00.362 --> 00:56:04.034
like to change a habit. You're making these little improvements. You're trying to make

906
00:56:04.072 --> 00:56:07.602
these 1% changes, these one degree shifts each

907
00:56:07.656 --> 00:56:10.818
day. And it's really easy to get

908
00:56:10.984 --> 00:56:14.642
frustrated or even depressed at that point. It's life. I've been running

909
00:56:14.696 --> 00:56:18.158
for three weeks. How come I can't see a change in my body? Or I've

910
00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:21.522
been writing blog posts for. Six months now, how come this site isn't popular

911
00:56:21.586 --> 00:56:25.334
yet? And the key point there is your work was

912
00:56:25.372 --> 00:56:29.158
not being wasted, it's just being stored. Complaining about sticking to a

913
00:56:29.164 --> 00:56:32.906
habit for two months or three months or even six months or

914
00:56:32.928 --> 00:56:36.566
a year and not having the outcome that you want is kind of like complaining

915
00:56:36.598 --> 00:56:40.074
about heating an ice cube from negative three to negative one degrees and it not

916
00:56:40.112 --> 00:56:43.694
melting yet. The work was not wasted. It's just being

917
00:56:43.732 --> 00:56:47.230
stored. And I love that quote that's in that same

918
00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:51.098
section from Jacob Reese, who it hangs in the locker room of the San

919
00:56:51.114 --> 00:56:54.666
Antonios who've won five NBA championships. And it

920
00:56:54.708 --> 00:56:58.546
says essentially, when I feel like giving up, I think about

921
00:56:58.568 --> 00:57:01.986
the stone cutter who continues to hammer away at the

922
00:57:02.008 --> 00:57:05.858
stone a hundred times without it splitting. And then finally on

923
00:57:05.864 --> 00:57:09.582
the 101st blow, it cracks in two. And I know that it wasn't

924
00:57:09.646 --> 00:57:12.886
the hundred that came there. I know it wasn't the 101st swing that did it,

925
00:57:12.908 --> 00:57:16.422
but the 100 that came before. Right. And it's that same

926
00:57:16.476 --> 00:57:20.214
idea. The reason the site takes off is not because

927
00:57:20.252 --> 00:57:24.026
of the one viral article. It's because of the 55 that your wrote in

928
00:57:24.048 --> 00:57:27.786
the weeks and months prior. The reason that you see a change in

929
00:57:27.808 --> 00:57:31.466
your body is not because today's workout radically transformed you.

930
00:57:31.488 --> 00:57:35.146
It's because you've been sticking to it for eight months now. And it's

931
00:57:35.178 --> 00:57:38.922
really about showing up. Continue to put those swings

932
00:57:38.986 --> 00:57:42.818
in, continue to raise the temperature by one degree, and eventually you

933
00:57:42.824 --> 00:57:46.466
hit that phase transition where you can see the results of your work.

934
00:57:46.568 --> 00:57:49.698
Yeah, and that image has been so

935
00:57:49.864 --> 00:57:51.860
powerful in my life.

936
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:57.386
I've been telling people about this book and I actually notice

937
00:57:57.518 --> 00:58:00.982
there's kind of like a coffee shop test. Like if I hear people talking about

938
00:58:01.036 --> 00:58:04.694
something from internet culture in a coffee shop, like real

939
00:58:04.732 --> 00:58:07.720
people, then something's hit and

940
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:11.100
Atomic Habits is like that. It hit

941
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:15.930
the kind of mainstream and that

942
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.514
image of just raising the temperature a little

943
00:58:19.552 --> 00:58:23.358
bit every day now I feel like I'm a

944
00:58:23.364 --> 00:58:25.920
few months into this and

945
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:29.680
I'm a little bit kind of like

946
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.562
evangelical about it. Now I'm like, God,

947
00:58:34.696 --> 00:58:38.322
my life is so much better. And it's because

948
00:58:38.376 --> 00:58:41.682
of just these little changes over time in the same

949
00:58:41.736 --> 00:58:45.474
direction. Now I can see it. Now I can

950
00:58:45.512 --> 00:58:49.298
see that I feel better. Wow, man, quitting alcohol, that

951
00:58:49.304 --> 00:58:52.406
was one thing. And then, wow, showing up at the gym three or four times

952
00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:55.974
a week, that really helps. And wow, like reading a real book every night before

953
00:58:56.012 --> 00:58:59.660
I go to bed, all of these things keep kind of adding up

954
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.834
and do make a meaningful difference in your life, even

955
00:59:03.872 --> 00:59:07.226
though way back when, when you're starting, you feel like, well, nothing's going to

956
00:59:07.248 --> 00:59:09.340
help me now.

957
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:14.558
I want to be clear that these ideas have

958
00:59:14.644 --> 00:59:18.240
meaningfully impacted my life. So, yeah,

959
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:22.878
I'm thankful you wrote that book. I'm thankful you talked to

960
00:59:22.884 --> 00:59:26.638
me in the airport. It's been really great for me. That's awesome. Thank you

961
00:59:26.644 --> 00:59:30.274
so much for sharing that. And ultimately that's what the whole thing is for,

962
00:59:30.312 --> 00:59:33.746
right? I mean, it makes it feel like it was worth the effort to spend

963
00:59:33.768 --> 00:59:37.522
a few years writing it and working on it, so that's great. So

964
00:59:37.576 --> 00:59:41.302
before you go, some people are asking what recommendations for

965
00:59:41.356 --> 00:59:45.174
system services, tools, trackers. I know you have a new

966
00:59:45.212 --> 00:59:48.566
one coming out. Do you want to talk about that? Sure, yeah. So I got

967
00:59:48.588 --> 00:59:52.426
it right here next to me, actually. So this is a Habit journal and we

968
00:59:52.448 --> 00:59:55.820
just launched it two weeks ago and

969
00:59:56.670 --> 01:00:00.074
it's basically a dot grid notebook. So if you're into bullet journaling or you're into

970
01:00:00.112 --> 01:00:03.766
keeping a notebook or use a notebook, the vast majority of it are dot grid

971
01:00:03.798 --> 01:00:06.878
pages, so you'll be able to use it like any normal one. But then at

972
01:00:06.884 --> 01:00:10.186
the back there's a section with habit tracker templates.

973
01:00:10.298 --> 01:00:13.374
And I don't know if you can see that very well, but I've been using

974
01:00:13.412 --> 01:00:16.414
it. For example, this is this month, so you can see me tracking my habits

975
01:00:16.462 --> 01:00:20.194
on here. Anyway, those

976
01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:23.666
templates are in the back and they're also perforated, so you can tear them out

977
01:00:23.688 --> 01:00:26.274
and put them on your desk or put them on your kitchen counter or your

978
01:00:26.312 --> 01:00:30.006
refrigerator or whatever. Yeah. And then at the very beginning of

979
01:00:30.028 --> 01:00:33.560
the book there is a section called One Line per Day.

980
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:37.650
So I've been using it for what happened today. And so I've been writing

981
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:41.474
down what happened each day and there are 31 lines,

982
01:00:41.522 --> 01:00:45.114
so one for each day of the month and there are twelve of them. So

983
01:00:45.152 --> 01:00:47.466
by the time you get to the end of the year, you should be able

984
01:00:47.488 --> 01:00:51.178
to flip through and see I'm doing what happened today.

985
01:00:51.264 --> 01:00:54.700
Sean Blanc does what's the highlight of the day?

986
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:58.654
Some other ones that I've seen are what am I grateful for? Or you could

987
01:00:58.692 --> 01:01:01.502
use it as like a productivity thing. You could say like, what's my most important

988
01:01:01.556 --> 01:01:05.326
task today? Things like that. So there are a lot of examples in

989
01:01:05.348 --> 01:01:08.866
the back of a notebook, I have like 16 pages of examples of how to

990
01:01:08.888 --> 01:01:12.110
use it. But anyway, it's called the Habit journal

991
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:15.746
and yeah, I'm excited about it. I think it'll be a good tool to help

992
01:01:15.768 --> 01:01:19.158
people build better habits. Cool. And a lot of folks, I've heard from a lot

993
01:01:19.164 --> 01:01:22.566
of folks that really like the audiobook, so if you folks aren't readers, go check

994
01:01:22.588 --> 01:01:25.986
out the audiobook. People like us read atomic

995
01:01:26.018 --> 01:01:29.754
habits. So

996
01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:33.500
thanks again for your time, James. I really appreciate it, man. Awesome. Thank.

999
01:01:47.924 --> 01:01:51.454
said, I really recommend the book Atomic Habits.com.
