podcasting hosting company.

podcast lover and listener.

9
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:31,125
Hi, Justin.

10
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:32,385
Justin: Hey, how's it going?

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,020
It's nice to be here.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,190
Thanks for coming on, Justin.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,330
I listen to the show every week, so
it's, it's fun to finally Awesome.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,270
Talk to people that you
only hear talking to you.

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,380
Yes, same actually.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:43,590
Yeah.

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,780
Ben: Stuck to have you.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,400
Noah: Yeah.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,320
We can kind of finally make
this one by one, uh, connection.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,750
Now we can just like talk
actually together instead of Oh,

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,950
you listen, then I'll listen.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
Justin: Yeah, totally, totally.

23
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,545
It's funny also because, uh,
I've, I've seen Ben before.

24
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:08,295
We've never talked, but I had to,
I had to come up with a vision

25
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:12,675
in my head of what Noah looked
like, and now, now I can actually

26
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:16,335
see for the rest of the listeners
at home, they, they can't, they

27
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:19,245
don't know yet, but now I know
I'm a part of the super club.

28
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:20,925
Noah: Yeah.

29
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:22,325
Was it what you expected?

30
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:25,485
Justin: Well, usually.

31
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:30,315
I've been podcasting since 2012
and usually I'm the disappointment

32
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:34,125
when people meet me in, in
person, they go, I thought

33
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,415
you would be a lot taller.

34
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:36,825
Noah: Yeah.

35
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:37,345
Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:38,715
Yeah.

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,845
See, I feel like that always
happens when you, you hear

38
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:44,085
someone's voice like you, you
know, if it's deeper, you kind of.

39
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:47,580
You know, depict a certain kind
of person in your mind, or if

40
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,800
it's, yeah, it just depend on
the voice and then usually it's

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,809
always not what you're thinking.

42
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:52,199
Yeah.

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,679
Justin: Yeah.

44
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,839
See, if I had to guess, I'd
guess that Noah is about six feet

45
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:02,789
tall, and I'm gonna guess Ben
is about the same height as me.

46
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm five foot eight.

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,759
How did I do?

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,490
Noah: So you're pretty good.

49
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,660
I'm six foot three.

50
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,440
Okay.

51
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:13,575
Ben: And I'm trying to calculate
centimeters to foot right now.

52
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:14,745
Justin: Oh, yeah.

53
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:19,485
I should see, this is the weird
Canadian thing, is that we use

54
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:23,895
the metric system, but we are so
close to the US that we end up

55
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,605
doing measurements and inches.

56
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:26,115
So

57
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:28,365
Ben: I'm almost
exactly six foot tall.

58
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:30,195
Justin: Oh, you're
almost exactly six feet.

59
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:30,765
Okay.

60
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:33,045
See, see now.

61
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:34,155
Now everybody knows.

62
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,745
Everybody's just adjusted.

63
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,480
You their mind.

64
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,959
Ben: Maybe you should just, maybe
you should just attach, uh, images

65
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,519
to the show notes of photos of us.

66
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,269
Justin: I think.

67
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,959
I think every podcast show notes
needs to have stats on, uh, people.

68
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,850
Noah, six foot three.

69
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:48,720
Ben.

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,350
Yeah.

71
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,280
60.

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,899
How many centimeters is that?

73
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,500
That's

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,557
Ben: one, uh, 180 5 or 180

75
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:54,990
Justin: 6.

76
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,190
180 5 centimeters.

77
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,399
Yeah.

78
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,079
Give people some stats.

79
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,579
You know, that's what they

80
00:02:59,579 --> 00:02:59,760
wanna

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:02:59,850
Noah: hear.

82
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,570
Dark bondish, dirty, blonde hair.

83
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,040
Mm-hmm.

84
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,280
Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,570
Form a picture.

86
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,470
So, uh, yeah.

87
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,440
So we're glad to have
you on the show, Justin.

88
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,760
Uh, we kind of two topics that
we're kind of interested in that

89
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,680
I know you talk a decent amount
about is like audience building

90
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,930
and like your market and starting
with a market instead of an idea.

91
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,250
Mm-hmm.

92
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,670
So we kind of wanted to jump into.

93
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,430
Both those two topics and just
kind of dig deeper, um, into that.

94
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,691
So, perfect.

95
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,120
Justin: It's like my favorite thing
thing to talk about right now.

96
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,350
Yeah.

97
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:40,560
That's good.

98
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,690
I think some people are
getting sick of me talking

99
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,600
about it, but I, I just
can't stop thinking about it.

100
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,720
So it's, it's what
naturally kind of comes out.

101
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,380
Noah: And actually I had, we
had a question about that.

102
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,840
Um, kind of like with
building an audience.

103
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:54,930
Mm-hmm.

104
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,519
That was one of the things
we were interested in, like.

105
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,030
Do you ever feel like you
run out of new things to say?

106
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,140
Justin: Um, I mean, one thing
that's been helpful for me is

107
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,440
that since 2013, we've had this
online community with Mega Maker

108
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,190
and so people are interacting and
asking questions all the time.

109
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:24,419
And those discussions often inspire
my thinking of, oh, wait a second.

110
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,640
It's actually, I.

111
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,080
Like, a lot of my tweets come out
of conversations that I've had

112
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,490
inside of MegaMaker, or things
I'm listening to on a podcast.

113
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,450
Um, or even things
I've read in a book.

114
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,020
You know, I'm, I'm reading
something and it, it

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,070
brings up these thoughts.

116
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:50,159
And I treat Twitter kind of
like, uh, kind of like the local

117
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,039
comedy club, you know, where
you go and test out material.

118
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,640
It's like, okay, I'm, I'm gonna
try this out and see how it.

119
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:58,034
How it lands.

120
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:01,994
And, um, it's also just
a, a helpful way for me

121
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,195
to process my thinking.

122
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:07,905
So no, I, I, I haven't run
outta things to talk about yet.

123
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:11,804
I do, I do have moments like John
and I are doing our podcast now,

124
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:15,794
and I think we're ready for the
year to be done in some ways.

125
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:18,914
You know, like ready for
things to kind of wind down.

126
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:23,534
Uh, and so I think there's
such thing as fatigue.

127
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,200
Mm-hmm.

128
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,000
When you're publishing something
every week and you eventually

129
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,930
need to give your brain space
to just explore, you know, other

130
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,880
things and have other ideas.

131
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,070
But yeah, not most of the time,
as long as I'm interacting with

132
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,960
people and real life situations
and also doing experiments in

133
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,110
my own life, I don't, I haven't
run out of anything to say yet.

134
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:52,395
Noah: Yeah, I could see
the fatigue in that.

135
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:56,055
Like, you feel like you're, you
have to have something to say like,

136
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,545
at least every week when you have
the podcast, like you have to have

137
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:01,575
a new thing that you're thinking
about or that you can dive into.

138
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:01,755
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:04,435
Yeah.

140
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,784
Yeah.

141
00:06:04,784 --> 00:06:05,895
Justin: We've definitely
kind of seen that.

142
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:05,955
Yeah.

143
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:09,735
And I, I think this is what,
that's why breaks are important.

144
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:14,055
Uh, I, I almost get this
more with 'cause podcasting.

145
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:17,085
You can just turn on the mics and
if you have a rough idea of where

146
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,724
you wanna go, you can talk it out.

147
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:25,995
But writing I find is a lot more,
uh, takes a lot more of my energy.

148
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:29,445
And so like writing that
weekly newsletter that I

149
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:33,525
write is, there are definitely
weeks where that is tough.

150
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:38,655
I, I not because I don't have an
idea, but sometimes to process

151
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:42,585
ideas and actually write it in
a way that makes sense is hard.

152
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:44,505
Um, but yeah, the.

153
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,025
Uh, in either case,
breaks are good.

154
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:49,905
Ben: I can always say I'm
receiving that newsletter.

155
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,165
And you're doing
pretty good, I guess.

156
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:53,045
Justin: Well, thanks.

157
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,005
At least I'm enjoying it.

158
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:57,495
That that almost gives
me more pressure.

159
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:58,905
'cause then I'm like,
oh, most people like it.

160
00:06:58,905 --> 00:06:59,565
I gotta keep going.

161
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:00,915
Yeah.

162
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:01,395
Well when

163
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:02,445
Noah: that came down, now

164
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:05,205
Ben: that case I hated it

165
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:06,245
Justin: every time.

166
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:07,245
Um,

167
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:12,195
Ben: So we got a, we got a
couple of questions about

168
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:13,695
audience and, um, mm-hmm.

169
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,125
I have a, I think I have
a pretty interesting one.

170
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:19,635
Um, that is what, what makes a good
audience, and do you think that you

171
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:23,565
should, like, do you think you, you
have to be part of your audience?

172
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,414
Like, um, do, do you have to feel
comfortable among the people?

173
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:27,615
Justin: Hmm.

174
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:32,655
So I'm ac I've actually changed
my tune a little bit on this.

175
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:33,224
Hmm.

176
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:40,965
I think now if you're starting
a business, Uh, the market

177
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:43,965
is the most important thing,
the market you choose.

178
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:48,585
And when I say market, I
don't mean market as in just a

179
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:50,715
identifiable group of people.

180
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:57,854
I'm talking about a group
of people that, uh, buys X.

181
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:00,645
So the diamond market.

182
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:04,545
Last year was 4.5 billion
or something like that.

183
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,015
To me, that's a market.

184
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:11,175
It's a market where you can
see people in motion, uh,

185
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:15,045
preferably buying something,
but sometimes it's just people

186
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:20,356
in motion doing something and
everything kind of hinges on

187
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,845
that which market you are in.

188
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:29,505
So, as an example, Taylor Twell
is the founder of Laravel,

189
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:33,434
which is the most popular p h p
programming framework in the world.

190
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,495
Uh, he has a huge audience.

191
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,944
If you look at his audience,
quote unquote on Twitter,

192
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:43,125
he's got, I dunno, hundreds of
thousands of, yeah, that's a lot.

193
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,635
Followers.

194
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:49,064
Let's, let's just check, because
I don't want people to be thought.

195
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:52,725
Well, uh, he has, okay.

196
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:54,915
He has 82,000 followers on Twitter.

197
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,495
So for a lot of people that
would be a big audience.

198
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,785
Mm-hmm.

199
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:01,545
And if you go to Lar
Con, you see he's got 800

200
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:02,835
people in the audience.

201
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:03,195
Right.

202
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,665
And he has, you know, tons
of people buying his stuff.

203
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,915
He has millions of
people using Laravel.

204
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:15,765
But all of that is in the
context of a bigger market.

205
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:20,505
There's, it's hard to count the
number of programmers in the world,

206
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:24,375
but let's just say a reasonable
estimate is that there's 5 million.

207
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,655
P h p programmers in the world.

208
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:27,285
Mm-hmm.

209
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:30,135
Um, would you agree with that, Ben?

210
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:30,765
Yeah,

211
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:31,305
Ben: definitely.

212
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:31,665
Okay.

213
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:33,735
I've actually, you know,
I've actually used for

214
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:34,515
a couple of projects.

215
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:35,415
Justin: Okay.

216
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,925
There you go.

217
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:43,365
And so, um, 5 million p h
p programmers in the world.

218
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:48,525
And let's just say, let's just
take one element of that market.

219
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,990
Not including all the tools
they buy, not including, you

220
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,449
know, everything else that
you need to be a programmer.

221
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,310
Let's just think about salary.

222
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,439
And these are, these are just
guesses, but let's say on average,

223
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,939
an average P H P programmer in
the world makes $25,000 a year.

224
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,370
Well, 25,000 times 5 million
is 125 billion I think.

225
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:20,445
That's $125 billion being
spent on salaries for

226
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,185
P H P developers alone.

227
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,605
That's a massive market.

228
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,875
It's not just a big group of
people, but it's also a big

229
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,175
group of people who, where
there's some sort of economic

230
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,585
activity being generated.

231
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:41,745
And, uh, I think it's why products
in the Laravel community often

232
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:48,150
have a magnified, um, Impact
compared to other things.

233
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,790
So, you know, I have a
course called Marketing for

234
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,560
Developers that did pretty good.

235
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,160
Mm-hmm.

236
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,370
But that's like if you take all
of the developers in the world

237
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,189
and then you ask how many of those
developers wanna learn marketing,

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,890
it's a much s smaller slice.

239
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:01,891
Right.

240
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,939
Yeah.

241
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,140
How many developers in the world
are p h P developers that want,

242
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,180
uh, to make their jobs better?

243
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,429
Well, that's probably 5 million.

244
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,540
Mm-hmm.

245
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,270
And so, You, you can compare
results and you can see that

246
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,020
kind of everything hinges on the
market, how big the market is,

247
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,199
uh, how big the, your audience
can be within that market.

248
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,390
Uh, and then all the multiples
all kind of depend on that.

249
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:33,300
So how much money is being
spent in that market already,

250
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,689
and how much of that can
you carve off for yourself?

251
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,610
Um, you know, Taylor presumably.

252
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:45,135
He's only carved off a little
bit of the P H P market.

253
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:48,314
Like there's still other
frameworks, there's still

254
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:52,755
programmers that don't know or
use about, sorry, don't know about

255
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,074
or use Laravel, so he's still got
plenty of room to grow as well.

256
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:03,255
But even then, like Taylor
Twell as a solo person has sold

257
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,145
$10 million worth of software.

258
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,145
To P H P developers.

259
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:09,314
Yeah.

260
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:10,035
That's pretty crazy.

261
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:11,655
That's insane.

262
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,235
And he just recently
took on employees.

263
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:18,944
So, um, you know, there's funded
startups in San Francisco right

264
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:23,805
now that have millions of dollars
in funding, uh, staff of 50

265
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:27,045
people, and they haven't sold
$10 million worth of software.

266
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:34,454
I think the market that you're
in determines everything and.

267
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,350
When you have, um, what Corey
Gwynn calls demonstrated

268
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:46,320
demand, so you can actually
see the demand, um, that's kind

269
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,160
of what you're looking for.

270
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,720
You're looking for people in
motion, a large group of people

271
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,890
in motion who are, where there's
economic activity being generated

272
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,150
from whatever they're doing.

273
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,040
Noah: So, yeah.

274
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,940
So you would basically say, start
out with the market, try to find a

275
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,810
market that you wanna work in, and
then start building your audience.

276
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,770
And around that, like, don't
worry as much about, uh, do

277
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,150
you feel comfortable, uh,
in that audience or Yeah.

278
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,570
Those kind of

279
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:16,110
Justin: things.

280
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,450
I mean, this is
where it gets tricky.

281
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,970
This is why business
is so hard because.

282
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:25,425
You have to, you apply all
of these filters to get to

283
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:26,685
right where you wanna go.

284
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:30,375
So it's like, it's not, it
can't, it's not enough to

285
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,545
just be in a good market.

286
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:34,185
You actually have to be
interested in that market.

287
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:40,185
You have to, you have good
founder market fit, you have

288
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:46,875
to, um, you know, you have to
then be able to identify some

289
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,425
sort of need in that market.

290
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,080
You have to, uh, then you have
to actually execute on some

291
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,700
things and, you know, make some,
make some sort of connection.

292
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,810
I don't think you have to naturally
necessarily build an audience, but

293
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:12,090
you get a lot of leverage from who
you know and who knows you, who you

294
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,950
know is just making connections.

295
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,840
We've, we're making
connections right now.

296
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,780
Now the three of
us know each other.

297
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:22,815
And, uh, even the fact that
we've been on a phone call makes

298
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:26,655
it a lot easier for me to ask
a favor of you in the future or

299
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,035
for you to ask a favor of me.

300
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,715
That's networking.

301
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:35,535
That's who you know, who knows
you, is the audience effect.

302
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:40,095
And, um, that, I mean,
that could be very helpful.

303
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:44,025
Uh, but there are people who,
who have built businesses

304
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,045
without doing that.

305
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,805
Uh, Ruben Gamma is a good example.

306
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,365
Of someone who's just built a
software business almost purely

307
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,865
on search engine results and
optimizing search engine results.

308
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:00,704
So I, I think it's one of
the levers you can use.

309
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:05,204
Uh, I think without any
sort of human connection,

310
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,104
it's very difficult.

311
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:07,324
So you have to, mm-hmm.

312
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:11,234
You do have to connect with
other human beings, and I get,

313
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:14,324
this is why it's helpful to be
interested in the market you're in.

314
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:16,365
Um.

315
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:23,175
And it's, sometimes it can
even, that can be enough.

316
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:26,775
Like I'm really interested
in the Laravel community.

317
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:30,344
I'm not really a Laravel
developer, but I've spoken at

318
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:32,055
their conference three times.

319
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:37,305
I really like the people and,
um, you know, uh, I would say

320
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:41,954
I'm part of the community even
though I, I'm not like a power

321
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:44,785
user of Laravel and mm-hmm.

322
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:50,610
Um, But, so there has
to be something that

323
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,960
draws you to that market.

324
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,630
There has to be something that
keeps you there, and you're

325
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,280
probably going to need some sort
of connection with some key people

326
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,410
in that market to make it work.

327
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,590
And it, you know, how you get there
is kind of the individual journey.

328
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm, I'm almost 40 now,
and, you know, it's, it's

329
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,520
very difficult to say.

330
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:20,265
Um, you know, what are the 10 steps
that brought you to transistor?

331
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:24,345
Because it's like layer on,
layer on layer of my life

332
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:26,865
going back to when I was a kid.

333
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:33,645
And so all of those steps up till
now lead me to where I'm at now.

334
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,375
I think you can optimize
for some of those things.

335
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:41,595
Like where you point yourself
in life has a big determination

336
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:42,765
of where you'll end up, right?

337
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:42,835
Mm-hmm.

338
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:44,535
Uh, I think.

339
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:48,495
The, the connections
you make matter a lot.

340
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:52,245
I think what you put out
into the world matters a lot.

341
00:16:52,245 --> 00:17:00,615
So, uh, you know, podcasting,
blogging, uh, public speaking, but

342
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:05,745
even just anything, uh, not, uh,
open source projects, anything you

343
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:08,204
put out into the world can help.

344
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:12,075
But in terms of like adding
all those up and going, okay,

345
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:13,755
what, what really matters.

346
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:16,245
A lot harder to to figure that out.

347
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:18,615
Yeah, I think

348
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:20,655
Ben: that's a pretty interesting
point because when we started

349
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:23,535
out with a podcast, I think we
were both like on the track of

350
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:24,385
we should build an audience.

351
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,885
And we just, it's kind of
like we are shifting, shifting

352
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:29,175
away from that a little bit.

353
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:29,505
Mm-hmm.

354
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:34,365
Um, and just recently came across
this tweet from Jane Portman and

355
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:38,565
I think Rob Walling, um, Jane
Portman from User List, um, who

356
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,595
were also talking about that, like
how they didn't really need an

357
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,485
audience and that basically just.

358
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,560
It, it just fits very well to
what you just said, I guess.

359
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:46,980
Mm-hmm.

360
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,730
Um, and there's one more thing
that I would like to like,

361
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,899
like get your opinion on, um,
because you're probably familiar

362
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:57,720
with, uh, Derek Rimer and what
happened with Level, right?

363
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:57,899
Mm-hmm.

364
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:58,350
Yeah.

365
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:02,159
It's kind of like, do you feel
like having an audience might

366
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,850
not al might not always be,
not necessary, but also maybe

367
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,720
like lead to false positives?

368
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,990
Justin: Mm-hmm.

369
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:08,070
Oh, definitely.

370
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:08,520
Yeah.

371
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,730
Uh, again, it can be
really helpful too.

372
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,760
Uh, there's to say that, um,
my audience didn't help in

373
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,970
launching transistor would
be disingenuous like that.

374
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,810
It definitely helped.

375
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:22,620
It still helps.

376
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:30,960
Um, but there is a risk
because what you're looking

377
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,389
for is you're looking for
some sort of momentum, right?

378
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,764
What and when you launch something,
You're trying to gauge what kind

379
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:41,145
of response is this getting?

380
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:44,985
So when Apple releases the
new iPhone, how many people

381
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,065
are lined up outside of
the Apple store right now?

382
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:56,625
Um, this Apple actually can fall
prey to this because they've

383
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,725
got all these mega fans, right?

384
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,754
Right that are gonna line
up day one no matter what.

385
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:05,084
So you could see these huge
lineups and you could go, oh

386
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:08,475
wow, like the new iPhone's a
big success, but unless the

387
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:13,814
rest of the world shows up, then
it's not going to be a success.

388
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:14,145
Right.

389
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,725
So yeah, that's a
pretty good analogy.

390
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:17,324
Yeah.

391
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,645
Lineups on day one.

392
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:26,385
I mean, they are helpful, but um,
they can, they can also, uh, you

393
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:27,584
know, like I've launched things.

394
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,360
I think still to this day, my
best launch ever was, uh, for

395
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,639
this, I was doing this online
series on product marketing and

396
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,419
like the first couple weeks,
tons of people showed up.

397
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,370
And when I started asking them,
what were you, what are you

398
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,800
hoping to achieve, you know, out
of this what brought you here?

399
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,719
They said, oh, I'm just a big fan.

400
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:55,780
I just get everything that you
put out and that's nice, but.

401
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:00,120
Uh, it became really
clear in the coming months

402
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,770
that no one else cared.

403
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:02,969
Hmm.

404
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:06,810
Uh, that's the disadvantage
of having an audience.

405
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,600
When people are really
kind of invested in your

406
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,300
journey, uh, they're gonna
show up no matter what.

407
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:13,860
They're gonna show up
just because they have a

408
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,060
personal connection to you.

409
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:20,280
But, uh, ultimately, if you're
gonna run a business, you need

410
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,330
people who are gonna show up.

411
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,580
And then more people were
gonna show up, and then more

412
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,630
people were gonna show up.

413
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,930
Right?

414
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,490
Uh, and, and this is actually
why I, I think the market

415
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,930
you choose matters so much.

416
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,410
And what I've gotten into
some public disagreements with

417
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,820
people who could be right.

418
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,030
I mean, they, these are my
friends and people I respect,

419
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:48,750
but the, the idea of going
after a small niche, I think.

420
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,455
And again, maybe people
are, I don't know.

421
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:57,375
The idea of going after a small
niche is just you're limiting

422
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,615
yourself to, let's say a
pool of 5,000, 10,000 people.

423
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:05,445
Well, that's like going to a little
tiny stream and trying to like

424
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:06,975
scoop up a little bit of water.

425
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:10,995
From a tiny stream as
opposed to going after a big,

426
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,794
massive market in motion.

427
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:15,105
That's like going to a rushing
river and just putting your

428
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:17,985
cup in the river and just
like scooping out a, you know?

429
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,195
Yeah.

430
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:22,334
And it, sure, you might be able
to fill up your cup just, you

431
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:23,834
know, at a small little stream.

432
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,594
But the rushing river has so
much water that it's, it's,

433
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:32,625
it's a lot easier for a solo
bootstrapper to just, you know,

434
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:35,205
put their cup in the river and
then scoop up a bunch of water.

435
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,610
And I think sometimes this
idea of niche is, uh, leads

436
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,260
people to the wrong places.

437
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,080
They're just looking for these
tiny streams that no one else

438
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,310
has ever discovered before.

439
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,570
Uh, where, you know, and
they say, well, we gotta

440
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,240
avoid the big rivers, because
everyone knows about those.

441
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:54,810
Yeah.

442
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,480
But it's a lot easier to get
your cup in a big river and,

443
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,510
and scoop out some water than
to find this tiny little thing

444
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,889
that nobody knows exists.

445
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:02,535
Yeah.

446
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:04,274
Ben: And the end, your cup
is bigger than the river.

447
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:06,285
Justin: Exactly.

448
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:07,185
Noah: Yeah.

449
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:11,895
I think, I wonder if where the
kind of disagreement that you

450
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:16,695
have with people about that
idea really just comes from like

451
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:20,475
the end goal with what people
want to do with their business.

452
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,475
Because basically where
I hear kinda what you're

453
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,085
saying, um, well, I guess
the opposite of what you say.

454
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:30,120
And that, you know, find a niche
market, the i'd, the advice

455
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,850
that I've typically seen that
from is places like Y Combinator

456
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,909
or, or startups that are really
trying to do like a go big

457
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,409
or go home kind of business.

458
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:40,530
Mm-hmm.

459
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,750
Um, like I think a good
example is, uh, Peter Thiel,

460
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,820
the, the co-founder PayPal.

461
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,199
His book Zero to One.

462
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:50,640
I don't know if you've
heard of that or mm-hmm.

463
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:50,643
Or, mm-hmm.

464
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:51,585
Or read it.

465
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:54,945
But I mean, that's almost
his whole thing is basically

466
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:56,865
go for the new markets.

467
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:59,655
Like that's where you
can make really, you can,

468
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:01,845
there's a lot of opportunity
to make a huge business.

469
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:04,635
And you know, that's kind of
like what, you know, PayPal,

470
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,335
Facebook, some of those
giant companies now did.

471
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:07,575
Mm-hmm.

472
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:10,785
Well, so yeah, if you're, if
people that are saying that

473
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:14,145
kind of advice are venture
capitalists or you know,

474
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:15,764
people that, that's their goal.

475
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,510
Then I, I could see that making
sense, but like, you know,

476
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:22,320
for bootstrappers, I think
that is then very dangerous.

477
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,680
Mm-hmm.

478
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,020
Um, and so maybe, I don't
know, I'm just wondering maybe

479
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,780
that's where the disconnect
is between those different

480
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,440
Justin: ideas.

481
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,500
Yeah, I think, I mean, part
of it is probably semantics.

482
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,570
Um, and part of it is this
is all really emotional stuff

483
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,445
because the way that you are
currently doing your thing, Kind

484
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:44,985
of informs your bias, the way
that you've achieved success

485
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:47,145
in the past informs your bias.

486
00:23:47,865 --> 00:23:51,765
I mean, I said things at 20 years
old that I don't believe anymore.

487
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:54,855
I said things at 30 years old
that I don't believe anymore.

488
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:58,365
And so a lot of this is
just, you know, what, where

489
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:03,345
we're at and what's working
for us right now and mm-hmm.

490
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:08,595
I mean, I was on Twitter, this
guy Evan Golden was saying,

491
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:16,890
um, Uh, you can stretch
the definition pretty wide.

492
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,580
It's always easy to justify, you
know, people are spending money.

493
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,310
Um, oh, what did he say?

494
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,310
He said, people are spending
money on tacos everywhere,

495
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:27,510
so this could justify.

496
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,990
Mean opening attacker, stunt
featuring dirt flavored tacos.

497
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,880
There's lots of evidence.

498
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,540
People wanted tacos And Evan's
a friend of mine, but these

499
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,460
are the kind of arguments
I get into on Twitter.

500
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:44,985
Yeah, but I think that,
unfortunately, that's exactly

501
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:49,365
what I do wanna do, is I want
to say, is there any evidence

502
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:56,054
in this market of prior of
demonstrated demand, that's just

503
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:58,215
a great word, from Corey Gwynn.

504
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:02,215
Uh, and so PayPal, let's
take PayPal as an example.

505
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:05,264
What was, what was the market?

506
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:08,625
For what PayPal was doing
before PayPal existed?

507
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:13,935
Well, it was massive that the,
the, the Western Union, like

508
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:17,565
bank transfer, like, you know,
money transfer market, uh, people

509
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:20,745
trying to pay for things with
credit cards online, but having

510
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:24,525
to go through their credit card
processors and there's all sorts

511
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:28,575
of friction, but there's tons of
evidence that there's billions

512
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,945
of dollars being spent in that.

513
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,730
Market already.

514
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,730
And so it's not like
PayPal invented anything.

515
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,090
I mean, sure, they, they created
a new way of doing those things,

516
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,129
but they didn't create the market.

517
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,710
They were riding a wave
that already existed.

518
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,830
Uh, they just saw the wave
coming and they built a better

519
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,490
surfboard that, you know,
enabled them to ride further

520
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,260
than anyone else had at the time.

521
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,290
Uh, and, and this is what I'm
talking about, is really, and in

522
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,205
some ways, uh, What Evan is saying
is like, I am, I'm stretching

523
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,575
the definition to say, is there
any sort of prior or existing

524
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:11,145
demonstrated demand for this thing?

525
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:18,945
And I think you could see that in
almost every major product launch

526
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:24,705
like the iPhone, before the iPhone
was the Blackberry and the palm.

527
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:27,945
And you know, you can keep
going back and back and back.

528
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:28,304
Right.

529
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:29,635
There's, mm-hmm.

530
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:33,525
There's demonstrated
demand for these things.

531
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:39,315
Even if you look at, um, I
can remember as a kid looking

532
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:45,315
in catalogs, wanting to buy
a portable television right

533
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:46,905
from Radio Shack or whatever.

534
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:50,055
There was demand for portable.

535
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:52,575
Televisions that were
battery operated.

536
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:56,655
They never worked very well,
but there was demonstrated

537
00:26:56,655 --> 00:26:58,125
demand for that thing.

538
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:01,905
Well, a big part of the iPhone
is just a portable television.

539
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:02,955
Right.

540
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:05,115
That's, at least that's how
my kids use it, that it's

541
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,555
like Netflix all day long.

542
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:07,215
Yeah, definitely.

543
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:14,115
Now, so I, I think the point
is to look for, Some sort of

544
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:20,145
demonstrated demand and, and to
think, is this a market in motion?

545
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:22,754
Is there evidence that
people are doing something

546
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:24,044
about this right now?

547
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:26,955
Um, so yeah.

548
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:28,814
Noah: Yeah.

549
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,415
So the, the market is
kind of being defined as.

550
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:36,915
Like a problem to be solved or
like a job to be done rather

551
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:40,965
than, I don't know, maybe how like
marketers sometimes think about

552
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:44,054
markets as almost, I feel like
they can kind of put it into a box

553
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:49,125
of like a specific solution or a
specific, uh, area in that way.

554
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:52,514
So yeah, really focusing
from what you're saying,

555
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:53,085
it sounds like, yeah.

556
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:56,625
Really focusing on the problem
that needs to be solved, is

557
00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:00,165
that a big market of people,
you know, want that, you know?

558
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:00,615
Justin: Mm-hmm.

559
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:02,125
Yeah.

560
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,570
Yeah.

561
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,140
Yeah.

562
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,630
You, yes, exactly that.

563
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,310
That's, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

564
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:15,270
The, the, there's lots, you,
you can see this with, uh,

565
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,780
if you go into Product Hunt
and you find, I run into this

566
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,540
all the time, products that
are no longer around, there's

567
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,880
all these like dead startups.

568
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,440
Oh yeah.

569
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,800
And in almost every case,
there just wasn't enough.

570
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,800
Demonstrated demand for that thing.

571
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,000
They were good ideas.

572
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:42,630
They, they kind of made sense
logically, but if you looked at

573
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,360
it and go, okay, but who's doing
something about this right now?

574
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,840
That's really what's most
interesting about Derek Reimer's

575
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,070
story is that once he started
talking to the people on his

576
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,610
waiting list, And asking,
okay, well what are you doing

577
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,050
about this problem right now?

578
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:58,740
Yeah.

579
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,920
And often their response
was, well, nothing.

580
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,670
We haven't done anything.

581
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,360
What?

582
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,490
You haven't searched on
Google for an answer.

583
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,120
No.

584
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,270
You haven't searched the
Slack extension store?

585
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,080
No.

586
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:16,140
Well that, that, that's a bad
sign if people aren't even willing

587
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,470
to do something free, which
is just search for a solution.

588
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:23,505
How are you gonna convince
them to jump over all of these

589
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:25,785
hurdles and actually take out
their credit card outta their

590
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:28,125
wallet and pay you for something?

591
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:33,885
Um, and this is another thing
I've maybe had a hard time to

592
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:41,415
articulate, is it it takes so
much momentum to get someone

593
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:46,125
to take out their credit card,
that you've gotta be sure

594
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:48,255
that what you're proposing.

595
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,030
Is something that they
really, really want.

596
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,900
And really the only way to, to
figure that out, the only way

597
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,170
to see that clearly is are they
doing something about it right

598
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,270
now, and is there enough of these
people on mass doing this, doing

599
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,110
something about it right now?

600
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:06,675
Ben: Yeah, I love
that piece of advice.

601
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:09,615
I actually thought that it's,
I, I think it was actually you

602
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:13,665
said that like, you should go to
Twitter and just search, search if

603
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:17,655
people are typing something like,
um, I don't know, like maybe even

604
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,515
using the, their grammar example.

605
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:23,445
Um, like search in Twitter
for switching away from Slack

606
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:24,315
or switch away from Slack.

607
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:24,405
Mm-hmm.

608
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:26,955
And see how many results
you actually find.

609
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,515
And there are a couple,
I did that for fun.

610
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,015
Um mm-hmm.

611
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:29,615
Mm-hmm.

612
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:32,445
Justin: But yeah, and I mean,
that's just step one, right?

613
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:32,865
Because it's.

614
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:37,045
It's pretty low friction to
tweet, um, your disappointment

615
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,235
with something, but at
least that's something.

616
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:43,915
And then, you know, you would
actually want to talk with folks

617
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:49,705
and ask them questions like, okay,
well, what caused you to switch?

618
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,275
How long did you think about
switching before it happened?

619
00:30:53,845 --> 00:30:57,445
Uh, what, what did you have
to do internally in your team

620
00:30:57,745 --> 00:30:59,065
to make that switch happen?

621
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,889
And that's where you're
gonna get a lot of answers.

622
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:05,250
It's one reasons I, I worked for
a, a project management software

623
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:10,139
startup, and what I didn't know
before I joined is how hard

624
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:13,139
it is to get people to switch
project management software.

625
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:18,345
And it's remarkably difficult
because, Everybody has an

626
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:19,815
opinion on the team, right?

627
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:19,875
Yeah.

628
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:22,905
The developers want one thing,
the marketing folks want one.

629
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:26,085
Another thing, the c t o
wants one thing, like it

630
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:27,435
goes around and around.

631
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:31,754
And so you have to convince
not just one person, but 10, 20

632
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:35,085
people to, to make this decision.

633
00:31:35,955 --> 00:31:39,764
Uh, and then the, the
other kind of bad sign.

634
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:42,885
So despite how difficult it
is to get people to switch,

635
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:44,804
people do switch all the time.

636
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,210
And that's also a bad sign
because they don't just switch

637
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,620
once and then they're satisfied.

638
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:49,679
Yeah.

639
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,020
They switch, they try Trello,
and then they're like,

640
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,980
Nope, this didn't work.

641
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,439
And then they try Basecamp
and then they're like,

642
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,370
oh, that doesn't work.

643
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,659
And then they try Jira.

644
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:59,100
Like they all end up in Jira.

645
00:31:59,159 --> 00:31:59,490
Right.

646
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,330
That's how it works.

647
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:01,649
Yeah.

648
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:08,100
Um, and so the, the, you know, when
you actually get into those real

649
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,760
discussions with people about what
does the actual process look like?

650
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,555
Um, Even, you know, a market
like project management,

651
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:23,955
it has its own, um, uh, it
its own minefield, right?

652
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:28,425
Like there's you, there's pros
and cons and, uh, I think for

653
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,895
Bootstrappers it's a lot harder.

654
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:33,885
It's why we've seen, you know,
Basecamp got in early and so

655
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,274
they've done okay, but really,
besides Basecamp, everybody else is

656
00:32:37,274 --> 00:32:40,095
venture funded because you mm-hmm.

657
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:41,565
It just costs so much money.

658
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,070
Uh, and if you get on their
list, like people, they

659
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,870
will, JIRA will call you.

660
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,090
They will, like, they've
got salespeople that

661
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,590
wanna onboard you, right?

662
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,250
Because they know the only way
to push this through the whole

663
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,240
funnel is to have a lot of kind
of concerted effort doing it.

664
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:05,129
So a lot of these things, a lot of
these decisions depend on whether

665
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:07,110
or not you're bootstrapping,
whether or not you're

666
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,790
bootstrapping as a solo founder.

667
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:13,695
Because some of these ideas and
markets are just harder to reach as

668
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:15,615
a bootstrapper or a solo founder.

669
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:18,045
Noah: Right.

670
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:22,485
So with that like in mind and
you know, starting with the

671
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,145
market, I guess, and maybe
some ways what sounds like

672
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,935
what you'd say is basically
start with the market filter.

673
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,075
Mm-hmm.

674
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,455
Like that's the first filter
that you want to put on Yes.

675
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:32,955
Of how to, yes.

676
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,940
Uh, basically choose what
problem you're gonna solve,

677
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,050
how you're gonna do it.

678
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:37,620
Mm-hmm.

679
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,130
Um, how do you, like, it
seems like, you know, you

680
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:46,230
start talking to customers,
you start talking to users.

681
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,800
It takes a while before you can
really know what's the right

682
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:53,940
approach, what's the right solution
to actually build, what do you

683
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,920
do if that solution ends up being
something that isn't something

684
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,210
that a bootstrapper can do?

685
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:00,270
Mm-hmm.

686
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:00,710
Or it's.

687
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:03,615
Or it's, or, or maybe it's
a solution that doesn't

688
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:04,965
use your strengths.

689
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:05,054
Mm-hmm.

690
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,814
You know, as a, as a
founder, it doesn't use

691
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:09,315
your skills, your abilities.

692
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:15,074
Um, so how do you handle that when,
I guess, starting with a market?

693
00:34:15,134 --> 00:34:15,225
Mm-hmm.

694
00:34:15,645 --> 00:34:18,764
Because, yeah, I mean, I guess
it, in some ways it kind of

695
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:21,465
goes back to there's just all
these filters and in some ways

696
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:24,014
all these things have to align,
which is obviously very hard.

697
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:24,375
Justin: Yeah.

698
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:27,344
I mean, I think that's
just the, this is.

699
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:31,964
Another unpopular tweet of mine.

700
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:37,034
But my, it is just, and I had to, I
had to admit this before I had any

701
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:41,625
success, but what you kind of have
to admit in some way on one side

702
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,935
is we're not all gonna make it.

703
00:34:46,694 --> 00:34:48,944
And a lot of people
don't like hearing that.

704
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,444
Um, but mm-hmm.

705
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,125
We're not all gonna make it there.

706
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:57,435
There's no way that every single
aspiring entrepreneur in the world,

707
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,470
Can apply all of these filters
and come out on the other side.

708
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,899
And by the way, even you come
out on the other side and you

709
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:09,419
know, like, I have a business
now that's doing pretty well.

710
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,089
It could disappear tomorrow.

711
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:16,049
Every day I wake up
going, well, maybe today's

712
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,310
the day it disappears.

713
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:17,730
Right?

714
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
Because markets change.

715
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:19,770
Mm-hmm.

716
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,109
And they can change really fast.

717
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:25,770
And so there's, there's no.

718
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,820
There's nothing really romantic
about starting a business.

719
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:34,110
It's just there's all sorts
of things that have to align

720
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:40,020
for it to work, and, um, a lot
of us aren't gonna make it.

721
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,600
So, so you have to hold, you
have to hold that on one side.

722
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,730
Well, at the same time,
on the other side, these

723
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,020
things are intention.

724
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,410
On the other side, you have
to be super optimistic that

725
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:53,250
you're going to make it.

726
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:57,465
And that you're just gonna
keep trying because, uh, the,

727
00:35:57,585 --> 00:35:59,865
the other thing I've seen
anecdotally, I don't know if this

728
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:04,185
is scientific, but the people who
keep trying, who keep working at

729
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:08,535
it, who keep pushing that ball
forward, many of them do make it.

730
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:13,395
And so there's a, there's a little
bit of how long can you last?

731
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:14,565
How long can you try?

732
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:15,255
Mm-hmm.

733
00:36:15,615 --> 00:36:18,855
Um, it's why a lot of successful
entrepreneurs actually tend

734
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,745
to be statistically older.

735
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:24,525
Because by that point in
your life, you've had a

736
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:26,265
bunch of industry experience.

737
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:29,355
So you know what an industry is.

738
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,815
You know, you've got connections
in that industry, you've

739
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,725
seen the pain points, you've
seen how they spend money.

740
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:38,925
You, you know, there's all of this
accrued experience that ends up

741
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:48,045
being helpful and um, you know,
it time is kind of what allows

742
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:49,305
you to keep pushing, right.

743
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:49,615
I.

744
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:52,335
So it's not saying you
shouldn't try in your twenties,

745
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:55,995
but because you could, it
could all align, right?

746
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:59,265
My friend Nathan Barry is
not even 30 yet and has

747
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:02,475
already achieved more as a
founder than a lot of folks.

748
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:08,415
Um, but I think you have to have
this idea of, well, it might not

749
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:11,865
happen, but I'm gonna try and
this might be a 10 year project or

750
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:13,455
this might be a 20 year project.

751
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:18,075
And, uh, you almost have
to be okay with that.

752
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:22,500
Like, This just might take time
for everything to align and

753
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,310
the whole time I'm going to
have to be working as if this

754
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,319
will eventually work out and
not just doing the same thing.

755
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,049
Putting yourself in new
circles, getting outside

756
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:35,160
of your comfort zone.

757
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:40,710
I've described this before as,
uh, is it, uh, command and conquer

758
00:37:40,714 --> 00:37:43,620
that uses fog of war where you're
just on a map and everything's

759
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,850
dark and you're exploring it?

760
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,270
Yeah.

761
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,330
Yeah.

762
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,950
So if you think about that as a
metaphor, like when you start out,

763
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,160
you're just in that map and all
you can see is around you, right?

764
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,770
And as you explore more
of the map, more and more

765
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,750
parts become illuminated.

766
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,590
And every once in a while you'll
end up in a spot of the map

767
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:04,049
where things just happen, right?

768
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,710
Like you get a bunch of
bounty or you run into a

769
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,240
bunch of enemies or whatever.

770
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,180
And it's kind of like that.

771
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,819
Like you're, you're walking around.

772
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:21,030
For me, for example, I was walking
around and I just happened to run

773
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:27,450
into Adam Wain, who I had no idea
who he was or anything about him,

774
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,290
but he ended up being quite an
influential person in the Laravel

775
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:36,390
community, and that was just me
wandering around the map and hit

776
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:37,890
him wandering around the map too.

777
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:38,940
And then us.

778
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:44,384
Uh, meeting each other and once,
once I could see, like I've learned

779
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:50,115
tons about, a lot of my thoughts
about like choosing a market first

780
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:56,265
have been because of the influence
of the Laravel community and

781
00:38:56,325 --> 00:39:01,605
looking at Taylor and Adam Wain,
and Steve Stroger and Jeffrey

782
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:06,045
Way build these crazy businesses
because in my little world

783
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,565
before I met them, you know, I.

784
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,380
This is the way things were done.

785
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,090
People like us do things like this.

786
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,900
And then I got over into that
area of the map and it was like

787
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,470
this whole new world opened
up that I'd never seen before.

788
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,190
And without that world opening
up, I don't think I would've,

789
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,140
um, well, I, I don't think a
lot of things would've happened.

790
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:35,009
And so there's clearly you
have to kind of be always

791
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:37,920
doing things, trying things,
getting outta your comfort zone.

792
00:39:38,384 --> 00:39:39,525
Meeting new people.

793
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:44,835
And I think the advice I
would give my kids is just to

794
00:39:44,835 --> 00:39:48,615
explore as much of the map as
you can, as early as you can.

795
00:39:49,935 --> 00:39:50,085
Yeah.

796
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,515
'cause the, the more
exploration you do.

797
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,335
I, I think I stayed
too local too long.

798
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:59,325
You know, I grew up in this small
little farming town in Alberta and

799
00:39:59,325 --> 00:40:03,435
then the big city was Edmonton and
I just spent too much time there.

800
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,825
And then, you know, like the
first time I flew into New

801
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:09,465
York, I was like, holy shit.

802
00:40:09,465 --> 00:40:12,375
Like there's a lot of people here.

803
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,635
There's a lot of money here.

804
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:13,636
Yeah.

805
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:16,455
There's a lot of businesses
here that I've never even

806
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:21,225
imagined before and it kind of
expanded my whole worldview.

807
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:25,305
And unless you're doing that work
to kind of walk around the map

808
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:30,405
and discover new, new areas, um,
yeah, I think I, I think it'll be

809
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:36,375
harder to, you know, to, to find
those markets, to find those ideas.

810
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:36,825
Yeah.

811
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:41,535
Noah: So, uh, I want to go back
a little bit to something you

812
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:46,335
said, you know, kind of talking
about how, um, basically this,

813
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:48,015
this might not work for all of us.

814
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:48,105
Mm-hmm.

815
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,025
And it's very hard and.

816
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,460
Um, yeah, we all might not make
it through, and that's just

817
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,740
kind of the, the truth of it.

818
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,800
Yeah.

819
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,340
So like how do you, and I'm just
curious about your situation,

820
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:04,530
like how do you go to your wife
with that and get her on board

821
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:08,270
for this whole journey of what
we're trying to do, because.

822
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,040
So that's, I'm just curious
'cause that's definitely

823
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,550
something I know me and my
wife struggle with, um, a lot.

824
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:14,830
Mm-hmm.

825
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,670
Just with, with my last
thing and like, it is hard.

826
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,490
So it's like it's, you know,
you're, it's not just you going

827
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,860
on this journey, you're bringing
your whole family with you.

828
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,340
Yeah.

829
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,230
Justin: I mean, again, you probably
don't wanna look at the statistics.

830
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:30,855
The, the statistics are pretty bad.

831
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:31,904
Ben: Just don't look.

832
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:34,665
So this podcast has to be
titled Unpopular Opinions.

833
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:36,015
Justin: Unpopular
Opinions and Jokes.

834
00:41:37,004 --> 00:41:40,035
I mean, it's just like, if
you want the reality, the

835
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:42,045
reality's not good statistically.

836
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:49,185
Um, I mean, clearly I think,
I think all entrepreneurs have

837
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:52,725
this feeling that maybe they can
do it better than the next guy.

838
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:57,225
And because statistically,
you know, millions of people

839
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,075
start businesses, but.

840
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:02,415
Uh, those people are in all sorts
of different places, have all

841
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:06,165
sorts of different leverage, have
all sorts of different privilege.

842
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:12,195
You know, there's, there's all
these factors that go into, you

843
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:15,095
know, why a person becomes a
successor, not, and I think every

844
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:19,575
entrepreneur feels like they've
got some secret sauce that'll make

845
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:21,655
them better than the next guy.

846
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:22,655
Oh, yeah.

847
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:28,890
But I mean, In my early twenties,
I started a couple retail shops

848
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,730
that ended up losing a lot
of money, and that was hard

849
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,670
to recover from as a family.

850
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,490
And so mm-hmm.

851
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,850
That, that is just part of it,
like if you're gonna be on that.

852
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,850
So that was almost 20 years ago.

853
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:52,080
And, uh, So now I'm at a place
where, you know, maybe I've

854
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,210
learned enough lessons and
I've made enough connections

855
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,930
that things are happening,
but that's a long journey.

856
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,760
That's 10, 20 years
of, of, uh, work.

857
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:09,300
And so, yeah, I mean, I think
that's something you gotta consider

858
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,190
with kind of, with everything.

859
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,330
Um, I, I don't think you should
kill yourself in the process.

860
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:15,930
I think.

861
00:43:16,545 --> 00:43:19,515
I think I worked probably
too hard a lot of those

862
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:20,505
years when I didn't need to.

863
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,225
It was just wasted cycles
trying to make something happen.

864
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:28,155
You know, you're, you're, it's
far better for you to book a

865
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:31,065
ticket to a conference that
you've never been to than to

866
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:33,615
work 60, 70, 80 hours a week.

867
00:43:34,605 --> 00:43:35,185
Um mm-hmm.

868
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:40,035
Because at least for me, the,
the biggest jumps forward

869
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:43,575
have been because I met
somebody outside of my circle.

870
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:49,950
I met John Buddha, the, my
co-founder in 2014 at this kind

871
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,900
of experimental technology art
design festival called xo xo.

872
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,910
And you know, I wasn't gonna
go initially, I had to kind of

873
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,820
push myself to get outta the
house and, and actually go.

874
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,040
So yeah, I, I don't think
there's any easy answers there.

875
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,280
I think you can stair
step your way up.

876
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:11,710
You can.

877
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:17,385
Um, do something small on the side
and then see if that evolves into

878
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:19,905
something bigger and then something
bigger and then something bigger.

879
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:24,555
Nathan Barry just wrote a piece
on this that I don't fully

880
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:28,665
like or agree with, but, um,
maybe I don't like it just

881
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:30,135
because it's the hard truth.

882
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:35,625
Uh, he talks about a series
of ladders and you know,

883
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:38,355
the first ladder is just
like trading time for money.

884
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,339
And then you kind of work
up that ladder, right?

885
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:44,490
You can work yourself up from
making minimum wage up to

886
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,700
making more money per hour,
but then you go to the next

887
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,620
ladder, which has higher earning
potential, but it's harder.

888
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,410
It's just like, okay, now you've
got to, you're trading time

889
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:59,250
for money, but it's, it's more
on your terms like consulting.

890
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,380
And so then you work your way
up that that level, uh, and

891
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,549
then there's another ladder.

892
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:08,685
And, you know, these keep
going and the difficulty with

893
00:45:08,685 --> 00:45:15,915
each ladder goes up and, but
your, your potential, in his

894
00:45:15,915 --> 00:45:18,105
case, he, he's just talking
about income earning potential.

895
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:19,045
Your income earning mm-hmm.

896
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,145
Potential goes up as well.

897
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:24,525
Um, and it is a little bit
of a stair step, right?

898
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:27,105
Like your moving your way up here
and then you're like, oh, well

899
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:28,695
there's opportunity over here.

900
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:32,025
So then you might take a few
steps back to start here and

901
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:33,015
then build yourself up here.

902
00:45:33,705 --> 00:45:35,625
And then you look at the
next slide, you go, there's

903
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:36,705
more opportunity over there.

904
00:45:36,705 --> 00:45:39,194
So then you go back down
and then work your way up.

905
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:44,535
Um, it, yeah, that's all possible.

906
00:45:46,365 --> 00:45:52,275
Definitely helps if you have, uh,
in terms of like, uh, having a,

907
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:55,815
a decent life, it helps if you
have a lot more cash saved up.

908
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:56,765
Mm-hmm.

909
00:45:56,895 --> 00:46:00,165
The more cash you have saved
up, the less stress you have.

910
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:03,825
Um, but that's not always
possible either, right?

911
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:10,154
So the, the, uh, the only way I can
think of to alleviate the stress

912
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:16,875
is to have very low cost of living
and, or a lot of money saved up.

913
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:19,755
Yeah.

914
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:23,325
Money that you can risk that you
wouldn't feel bad about losing.

915
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:28,845
So, and you can even hear
this in John and I's podcast.

916
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,980
You know, um, he was working for
Cards Against Humanity when we

917
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,029
started this, and he also had
more money saved up than I I did.

918
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:43,020
And so my stress level
when we weren't quite yet

919
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,090
full-time yet was a lot higher.

920
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,890
I'm just like, oh God.

921
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:48,240
Like do we gotta take investment?

922
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:52,470
Do we gotta try to add three
or four more things on top

923
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,640
of this to make this work?

924
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:59,070
You can see how like desperation,
um, Affects your actions.

925
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,620
And a lot of businesses you'll
see do this, like one thing's

926
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,850
not working quite enough.

927
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,610
So then they add another
thing to hopefully bring up

928
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,680
in more income, and that's
not quite bringing enough.

929
00:47:07,685 --> 00:47:09,600
So they add another thing and
they just keep adding more

930
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:12,210
and more stuff and more and
more stress to their lives.

931
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:16,590
Uh, but yeah, for, for
John, yeah, it's easy.

932
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:23,160
He's got no dependence and uh,
his cost of living's low and he

933
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,630
had a bunch of money saved up.

934
00:47:25,065 --> 00:47:26,805
It's like for him.

935
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:27,135
Yeah.

936
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,065
This isn't, that's easier.

937
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,355
This isn't make it or break it.

938
00:47:29,355 --> 00:47:33,285
It's like, no, I can just, if
this doesn't work, yeah, I'm fine.

939
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:37,905
So that if you wanna make it
easier, I think lower your

940
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:43,185
expenses and save a bunch of
money or, Get someone to give

941
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:47,355
you a bunch of money or rob a
bank, a rob a bank, or whatever.

942
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:49,425
Noah: That goes

943
00:47:49,425 --> 00:47:50,145
Justin: easy route.

944
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:54,015
I mean, this is why privilege
plays such a big part in business.

945
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:55,095
Like some people do.

946
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:57,165
They, they get a, they
have a big trust fund and

947
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,125
they get a bunch of money.

948
00:47:58,755 --> 00:47:58,785
I.

949
00:47:59,009 --> 00:47:59,940
It does help.

950
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:00,930
Yeah.

951
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,080
I

952
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,290
Ben: agree.

953
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,279
Noah: Yeah.

954
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:03,660
Yeah, that makes sense.

955
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:08,339
So maybe as a last question,
we could end with maybe you've

956
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:11,700
heard, uh, the, how I built
this podcast, they always end

957
00:48:11,705 --> 00:48:12,839
with an interesting question.

958
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:12,930
Mm-hmm.

959
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,140
Which is, so for you, I'm just
interested in hearing as well,

960
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,690
like, With transistor, like
where you guys gotten so far,

961
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,140
how much do you think of that
was luck and how much of it

962
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,670
was, you know, you and John's
skill and talents and hard work?

963
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,680
Justin: It's definitely the
accumulation of a lifetime

964
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:39,010
of experience and I think, I
think your attitude matters

965
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,810
a lot in that, right?

966
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,880
Like are you gonna
keep going out and.

967
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,879
Trying things.

968
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:47,669
Are you gonna keep going out
and trying to push the envelope?

969
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,120
Are you gonna keep going out
and put things out in public?

970
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:54,509
Are you going to go
out and meet people?

971
00:48:54,509 --> 00:48:58,740
Like if, if, if you were gonna
split test my life and he put

972
00:48:58,745 --> 00:49:01,740
one Justin in his room and he
never leaves and all he does is

973
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,450
play Sonic the Hedgehog forever.

974
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,009
And then you have another
version where he's like, always.

975
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,050
Going out and trying to figure
things out and trying to build

976
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,720
things and trying to write and
trying to meet this person.

977
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:22,740
And for sure in that AB test,
you know, Justin b uh, wins.

978
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,920
There's, I don't think
it's, that's a, it's not

979
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,030
too difficult to see that.

980
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:36,734
So yeah, there's a lot of luck
in where I was born and, um, But

981
00:49:36,734 --> 00:49:42,194
you're the, the, the, the influence
of luck starts to go down a lot.

982
00:49:43,035 --> 00:49:46,545
Like the, the, the, the
influence of blind luck.

983
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:51,345
Like just like where you were
born, like what, what year

984
00:49:51,345 --> 00:49:54,345
and country and location and
parents you were born to.

985
00:49:54,884 --> 00:49:59,325
After that part, you make your
most of your luck just by whatever

986
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,005
attitude you have every day.

987
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,410
Mm-hmm.

988
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,450
There's still some privilege
that comes with where you were

989
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:11,040
born, but most of that kind of
built in luck is already happened

990
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,030
by the time you were born.

991
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:14,640
Noah: Yeah.

992
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,200
Cool.

993
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,330
Well, thanks Justin for coming on.

994
00:50:18,335 --> 00:50:20,040
That was a good conversation.

995
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,320
Very helpful for both of
us and hopefully, I'm sure

996
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,190
for our listeners as well.

997
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,730
Hopefully I didn't bum

998
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,510
Justin: you out too much.

999
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:26,235
No,

1000
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:28,755
Noah: I mean, sometimes you

00:50:28,755 --> 00:50:30,765
you back, back to the truth.

1002
00:50:32,175 --> 00:50:34,215
Um, so yeah, thanks Justin.

Ben: and we'll put
everything in the show notes.

1005
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:42,285
All right.
