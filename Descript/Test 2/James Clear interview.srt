1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,830
Narrator: This is Transistor fm.

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,650
Justin Jackson:
Hey, product people.

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,940
Justin Jackson here, and I've
got a brand new interview for

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:28,650
you with James Clear, who is
the author of Atomic Habits, a

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,729
book that has really changed my
life, uh, since I've read it.

6
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,420
And I, I don't want to give
too much of an intro, I

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,300
just wanna get right into
the, the actual interview.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,270
Uh, if you like this,
please reach out to James

9
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,430
on Twitter at James Clear.

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,430
And if you have comments
about the episode, reach

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,600
out to me on Twitter.

12
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:52,410
I'm the letter M, the
letter I, Justin m i Justin.

13
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:58,905
Here is me and James talking about
habits and how you can make your

14
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:01,785
life better one day at a time.

15
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:10,695
The book, your book's
been out for a while.

16
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,795
It's right here to habits.

17
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:16,815
If you see it in an airport
or something near you, how

18
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:17,775
long has it been out now?

19
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:21,225
James Clear: Uh, today
is a hundred days.

20
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:21,705
Exactly.

21
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:22,155
No way.

22
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:25,634
So yeah, so just, uh, just
over three months, you

23
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:28,365
Justin Jackson: know, I'm,
I'm curious 'cause now

24
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:30,705
it's been out for a while.

25
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:37,125
Is there one idea that you
see that people keep sharing?

26
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,005
Like one idea that resonated
from the book in particular, that

27
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:43,695
gets shared more than anything
else on Twitter or wherever?

28
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:44,715
Um,

29
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,775
James Clear: so I, I was
curious about that myself when

30
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,695
I was, you know, writing the
book and thinking about it

31
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:51,164
because I, I kind of felt like.

32
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,289
All right.

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,690
You know, hopefully all
these ideas are useful, but

34
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,880
what's the one thing that
people are gonna latch onto?

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,369
Because sometimes you'll hear
that from authors that like,

36
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,220
there was one chapter or
something that was the chapter

37
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,080
that really stuck with people.

38
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:04,619
Yeah.

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,619
Um, I'm grateful for the
fact that there are a variety

40
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,540
of things, but the, there,
um, there are a few things.

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,170
So the first one is identity-based
habits, which is chapter two.

42
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,230
Yeah.

43
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,579
Um, and that concept,
it really seems to have

44
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,870
resonated with people.

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,660
The idea of like trying to
reinforce your desired identity

46
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,060
and kind of like starting with
who you wanna become rather

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,470
than what you want to achieve.

48
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,100
Yes.

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,359
And, uh, I'm glad that it did,
because that was the chapter

50
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:36,359
I debated over the most of
where to put it in the book.

51
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,579
I had it, it it at
different points.

52
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,690
It was the first chapter.

53
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,920
It was the last chapter.

54
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,600
It ended up being the second one.

55
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,450
I also had this a thought in
my head that it should be like

56
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,769
about midway through the book.

57
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:49,155
So it really jumped
all over the place.

58
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:52,305
But I ended up thinking, I feel
like this is one of the best

59
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,215
ideas, so I want to have it
early so that people, even if

60
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,734
they don't finish the book, they
still come across this idea.

61
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:58,155
Yeah.

62
00:02:58,185 --> 00:03:01,665
And I'm glad that, uh, that,
that ended up working out well.

63
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:05,175
Um, the other one that,
uh, people bring up a lot

64
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,105
is the two minute rule.

65
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:10,425
Um, and the idea of like scaling
your habits down to the point where

66
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:11,775
they take two minutes or less.

67
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,234
I think that that's like
a very actionable one.

68
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,365
You know, it's like, okay,
I know exactly what to do.

69
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:18,915
I wanted to do a workout,
but now I'll just focus

70
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,025
on doing five pushups.

71
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:23,685
Or I wanted to read 30 books
this year and now I'll focus

72
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:25,965
on reading one page a day,
or something like that.

73
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:26,355
Gotcha.

74
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:30,255
So I think the actionable of that
one also, uh, tends to stick.

75
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:35,445
Justin Jackson: And so going back
to the identity one, um, is this

76
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:40,515
the idea that every action you
take or every habit you develop

77
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:42,465
is a vote for the person you wanna

78
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:43,035
James Clear: become?

79
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:44,235
Right.

80
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:48,555
So that's kinda like my core,
um, philosophy behind it.

81
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:53,505
This idea that the way that
we develop beliefs about

82
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:57,375
ourselves, that we reinforce
our self-image, that we, uh,

83
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:01,445
develop our identity to a certain
degree, is largely reinforced

84
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,145
by the experiences and behaviors
that we perform over time.

85
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:05,295
Mm-hmm.

86
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,865
So some aspects of your
identity are relatively fixed.

87
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:12,405
Like for example, if you're
tall or short, but even that

88
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:16,035
idea that I am tall or I am
short, that's reinforced.

89
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:18,285
You learn that through
experiences in life.

90
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:23,055
Um, now there are many aspects
of your identity that are less

91
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,775
fixed than that, but are still
reinforced by your experiences.

92
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:32,145
So if you, you know, go, uh, if
you write one sentence today,

93
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:35,655
you probably don't think about
yourself as I'm a writer.

94
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:39,195
But if you do that every day for
six months or nine months, or a

95
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,525
year, At some point you turn around
and you think, huh, maybe I am the

96
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,724
kind of person who is a writer.

97
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:43,784
Yeah.

98
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:48,405
Or you know, if you, uh, if you
study biology every Tuesday night

99
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:52,245
for 20 minutes, like you at some
point think, I guess I'm studious.

100
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,625
You know, I keep
doing this every week.

101
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:55,245
Like maybe this is the
kind of person I am.

102
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:55,604
Yeah.

103
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:59,655
And so I like that idea that
our habits are like votes for

104
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:02,775
the, the type of person we
believe that we are, that they

105
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:06,075
build up evidence of looking
at ourselves in a certain way.

106
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:06,375
Mm-hmm.

107
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,065
And I like to phrase it that
way, not only 'cause I believe

108
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:14,085
that it's true, but also
like beliefs and behavior

109
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,465
are kind of a two-way street.

110
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:15,885
Right.

111
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:19,515
So like you can, you'll hear
people say things like, Well,

112
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:21,945
you know, just be positive
or just believe in yourself

113
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:23,205
or fake it till you make it.

114
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:23,265
Yeah.

115
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:24,075
Or things like that.

116
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:27,914
And there's nothing
necessarily wrong with

117
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:28,965
fake it till you make it.

118
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:31,425
Like it's, it's fine to be
positive and believe things about

119
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:36,405
yourself, but it's a very short
term strategy because fake it

120
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:39,585
till you make it is asking you to
believe something about yourself

121
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:41,175
without having evidence for it.

122
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,175
You know, it's like that kind
of visualization stuff or

123
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,125
mantra stuff where you look at
yourself in the mirror and you

124
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,265
tell yourself, I'm a writer.

125
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:48,015
I'm a writer.

126
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:48,284
Yeah.

127
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,544
Even though you
haven't written yet.

128
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,755
Um, and so what I'm
saying is similar, but.

129
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,729
I think importantly different
in the sense that you let

130
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,400
the behavior lead the way
rather than the belief.

131
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,630
And I, I think that's the best
lever we have for changing the way

132
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,780
that we look at ourselves, which
is to say, show up and write a

133
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:10,169
sentence every day and soon you're
gonna have something to root that

134
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,479
new identity of I am a writer in.

135
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:15,419
And it gives, it's a much more,
I think, robust and long-term

136
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,560
way of changing how you look at

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,010
Justin Jackson: yourself.

138
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,400
Yeah.

139
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,039
I think for me, the 'cause you
first communicated that idea

140
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,789
to me in an airport in Denver.

141
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,380
James Clear: Yeah, I remember

142
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,590
Justin Jackson: that.

143
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,810
And the, at the time in my
life, I was not doing so good.

144
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,969
I was, uh, depressed.

145
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:39,960
I was, I think cynical, especially,
I think cynical about people

146
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,780
like you that seem to have
it all together, that seem

147
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,620
to have, be really like doing
all the, the, the good habits.

148
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,409
And when you're not doing so good.

149
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,480
Looking at someone that, you know,
seems to have it all together,

150
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,490
just can make you more grumpy or
more cynical, or more whatever.

151
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,530
But I remember you sitting down
and, and kind of hashing this out

152
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:11,940
with me and that idea of Justin, no
matter where you're at right now,

153
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,480
and no matter what you've done, you
could start today with one action.

154
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,120
So if you, you know, go
running today, that might

155
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,050
not make a big difference.

156
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,440
But then if you do it tomorrow
and then the next day, and then

157
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,270
the next day, and then the next
day at the end of the week, you

158
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,620
might say, well wait a second.

159
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,560
I, I think I'm a runner, right?

160
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,350
And maybe, you know, after a couple
weeks you might say, well, you

161
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,110
know, I'm gonna get myself some
runner clothes and go and get some

162
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,720
runner clothes, and then I'm gonna
get myself a good pair of shoes.

163
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,300
I'm gonna install that Strava app.

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,050
Hmm.

165
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,880
And all of a sudden
you could see yourself.

166
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,890
That was very, that was a really
hopeful message for me when I was

167
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,480
really struggling to figure out.

168
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,620
It was way easier for me to be
cynical and just kind of look back

169
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,610
at all these people implementing
good, healthy processes and

170
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,840
say, well, that's not for me.

171
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,820
That's just for people
that, whatever, you know.

172
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,590
But seeing, hearing that
gave me hope to think,

173
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,760
you know, I could do that.

174
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,270
I could.

175
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:20,710
And it's surprising how little
time it takes to mm-hmm.

176
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,050
You know, accomplish that.

177
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:24,164
Is that something?

178
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:25,034
Ha ha.

179
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:28,395
Have other people been
kinda referencing that too?

180
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:32,355
Is that part of the, the, and
maybe that's what's so good about

181
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,414
having it as chapter two, because
it gives me some hope, right?

182
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:35,475
Yeah.

183
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:36,465
Well,

184
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:39,495
James Clear: what's interesting is
that that process of changing in

185
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:41,174
that way, it's happening anyway.

186
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,335
You know, like, I mean, if
you think back to like the

187
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:46,245
beginning, like for example, if
I think of my, the early days

188
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:47,595
of my entrepreneurial career.

189
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:47,805
Mm-hmm.

190
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,505
Well, I didn't have any
entrepreneurs in my family.

191
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,845
I didn't have any close
friends who were entrepreneurs.

192
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,564
There was no reason for me to think
that's who I am or to feel like

193
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:59,505
I was externally validated with,
like, that was part of my identity.

194
00:08:59,564 --> 00:08:59,685
Yeah.

195
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:00,795
I had no evidence of it.

196
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:03,645
And so early on I just,
all I had was hope.

197
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:04,005
Right?

198
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:06,345
Like the hope that, oh, maybe
I'll be able to build something.

199
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,694
Maybe I'll be able
to make this work.

200
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:08,265
Yeah.

201
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:11,865
Um, but then you start to show up
and for me it was probably about

202
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:14,865
two years in, it's probably about
where the, where I kind of like

203
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:18,555
the scale tipped and I started
to think I am an entrepreneur.

204
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:22,064
Like that's part of, of who I
am, but it really took proving

205
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:26,564
it to myself that I can pay my
bills through this, you know,

206
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:30,405
that I can like actually have a
lifestyle and a career in this way.

207
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:30,525
Yeah.

208
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:33,255
I had to prove it for about
two years before I really

209
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,865
started to latch onto it
and say, this is who I am.

210
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:36,225
Yeah.

211
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:41,655
Um, and, uh, so my point
is that's always happening.

212
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:44,505
You're, you're always,
you're continually updating

213
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:47,415
your beliefs about yourself
based on the experiences

214
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:48,315
that you're going through.

215
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:48,555
Yeah.

216
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:52,935
And all I'm talking about is simply
designing that process in a little

217
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,205
more careful or thoughtful way,
rather than just kind of letting

218
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:59,475
it happen to you and be like, well,
I guess I'll figure out who I am

219
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,944
based on what life throws at me.

220
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,155
Yes.

221
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:01,575
Versus.

222
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:05,145
How about I figure out who I am
based on the votes that I cast

223
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,995
each day and what I decide to,
what habits I decide to follow.

224
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:08,325
Justin Jackson: Yeah.

225
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:08,925
Yeah.

226
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:13,215
Again, like that is a, a very
hopeful message for, for someone

227
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,405
who's just kind of sitting back
and waiting for it to happen.

228
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:19,725
Um, what, what sustains
you when you're in the.

229
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,900
In the process, but not there yet.

230
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,560
Hmm.

231
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,200
Like, like you mentioned
entrepreneur and you're like,

232
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,730
man, it took a long time.

233
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,510
Yeah.

234
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,460
James Clear: What sustaining,
that's a really good question

235
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,980
because I think a lot of habits,
you know, entrepreneurship is

236
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,600
certainly this way, exercise is
this way where the, the rewards

237
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
of a habit are often very delayed.

238
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,140
Uh, you know, like what's
the reward for working

239
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,310
out for like three weeks?

240
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,320
Like, not really a
whole lot, honestly.

241
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,970
Your body hasn't really changed.

242
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,010
The scale is probably
about the same.

243
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,440
Um, you're probably
just sore, you know?

244
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,441
Yeah.

245
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,960
Like, there, there probably isn't
like a whole lot to show for it.

246
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,170
Yeah.

247
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,170
It's really not, unless you
stick with that habit for

248
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,500
three months or six months or
a year, that you actually start

249
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:06,470
to see the changes you were
hoping to get when you set out.

250
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:06,890
Yeah.

251
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,100
And so there's kind of this like
valley of death in the beginning.

252
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,280
Mm-hmm.

253
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:10,450
Where.

254
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:13,555
In a way, it's sort of
like gets harder before

255
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:14,574
it gets easier, you know?

256
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,895
It feels uncomfortable.

257
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:19,194
You feel sore and pain,
uh, you feel uncertain

258
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:20,125
when you walk in the gym.

259
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,385
You feel like people
are judging you.

260
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:21,805
Yeah.

261
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:24,745
Same way with starting a business,
you know, in a weird way it's kind

262
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,185
of harder before it gets easier.

263
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:28,255
You start out, but you're
not making any money.

264
00:11:28,435 --> 00:11:30,564
You feel stupid a lot of the
time 'cause you're, you don't

265
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,865
know how to make a sales call
or what customers are looking

266
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:36,714
for or whether you're even
offering the right product.

267
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:37,045
Yeah.

268
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:40,825
Um, I remember when I first
started, I, uh, I, like I said,

269
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,075
I didn't know anybody, didn't
have any entrepreneurs in my

270
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,235
family, so I was like, well, I
need to get to know some people.

271
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:45,475
Yeah.

272
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,295
So I sent a bunch of emails
to reach out and just ask if

273
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:50,965
people would chat on Skype for
like 30 minutes or whatever.

274
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:54,235
And I remember sending those
first few and thinking, is this

275
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,585
even, do people even do this?

276
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:57,985
Do people chat on Skype with people
that they haven't met before?

277
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,695
Like, is this a weird thing to ask?

278
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:02,185
You know, there's just a lot
of that uncertainty early on.

279
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:02,605
Yeah.

280
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:06,325
So your point is, I think, a
valid one, which is, well, what

281
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,645
do you do to get through that?

282
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:09,505
You know, like how do you,
how do you kind of get

283
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:11,935
through that valley of death
while you're waiting for the

284
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:13,585
long-term rewards to accumulate?

285
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:17,935
Yeah, and I think that this is
where, uh, psychologists call

286
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:22,315
it reinforcement or an external
reinforcer, but you, you want

287
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:26,185
some kind of reinforcement that is
enjoyable in the moment so that you

288
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,415
have a reason to keep showing up.

289
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:27,625
Okay.

290
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:31,135
So there are, there are kind of,
from a habit standpoint, there

291
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,425
are kind of two ways to do this.

292
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:36,945
First thing is just a strategic
choice about what type of

293
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:38,175
habit you choose to follow.

294
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:42,795
So if we go back to the exercise
example, well not everybody has

295
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,145
to work out like a bodybuilder.

296
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:47,505
You know, you could do
Pilates or yoga or go for a

297
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:50,865
run or rock climbing or, you
know, all kinds of stuff.

298
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:51,195
Yeah.

299
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:55,575
And so pick the form of a habit
that brings you the most joy

300
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,285
that is most enjoyable to you.

301
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:57,585
Yeah.

302
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:59,685
It's gonna be a slog for,
you know, you're gonna

303
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:02,115
have to swim for months to
see a change in your body.

304
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,465
You're gonna have
to cycle for months.

305
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:04,905
You're gonna have to
lift weights for months.

306
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,765
It doesn't really matter
which one you choose.

307
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:07,695
It's gonna take a while.

308
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:07,965
Yeah.

309
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,695
So you might as well choose
the one that's most exciting

310
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:11,565
or enjoyable to you.

311
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:11,865
Yeah.

312
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:12,255
Um.

313
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,459
Yeah, same way with like, you
know, imagine a reading habit,

314
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,770
you know, like you don't have
to read, you might feel like,

315
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,199
oh, I have a business so I
need to read business books.

316
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:23,199
But really, ultimately the most
important thing is do you get

317
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:25,479
in the habit of reading, do
you fall in love with reading?

318
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:25,719
Yeah.

319
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,489
So if you need to start with sci-fi
books or fantasy or something

320
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:31,839
like that, well start with that.

321
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,109
You know, like do do the one that
is, uh, intrinsically valuable to

322
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:38,650
you at first, and once the habit
is built, then you can transition

323
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,939
to some of the other stuff.

324
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:40,359
Yeah.

325
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,479
Um, so that's one method for,
for kind of getting through that

326
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,199
Justin Jackson: value of death.

327
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:44,430
Yeah.

328
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:52,780
And I think this brings up maybe
a harder question, which is, so,

329
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:57,729
you know, based on your book,
it's January and I'm thinking,

330
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,760
okay, you know, I haven't been
in the gym for seven years.

331
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,469
I used to love working out.

332
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:03,819
I'm gonna go, I.

333
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,020
I got my streaks app on my
phone, start going, and, uh, I've

334
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,830
probably been, I don't know, I've
probably been at least 18 days,

335
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,540
or maybe even 20 days this month.

336
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,280
So it's great.

337
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,170
And I was surprised
by how fast I felt.

338
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,410
So the first day I felt like
I didn't belong, felt awkward.

339
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,280
I don't know anybody here.

340
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm walking in, I, some
of the machinery, I, I

341
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,170
recognize some, I don't.

342
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,980
I have to like, you know,
find, get back into a routine.

343
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:37,319
I have to find which
exercise I'm gonna do.

344
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:41,370
There's all these kind of
insecurities and questions.

345
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:46,725
But after a week, I kind
of felt like I belonged.

346
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:47,355
Hmm.

347
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:51,704
But I wonder if that's
because it was easier for me.

348
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:56,685
You know, I, I had this, you
know, I'm, I'm relatively, I

349
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,785
was already relatively in shape.

350
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,105
Um, so there's a big difference
between going in where you feel

351
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:05,954
like, oh, maybe I'm a few pounds
overweight and going in and

352
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:07,694
being 200 pounds overweight.

353
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:13,035
There's a big difference between,
you know, going in even as a

354
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:16,665
white male compared to, you know,
the, there's a, a big difference

355
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,935
going in and feeling like, well,
I've done these exercises before,

356
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:25,454
so I'm not completely outta my
element, and I'm wondering how it.

357
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,320
I mean, are, are, are
habits like that achievable

358
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,960
because of privilege and
context and other things?

359
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,820
Like how much does
that play into it?

360
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,920
And, you know, if someone is
walking in and they're 200 pounds

361
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,210
overweight is, you know, do
they still have the same chance

362
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,780
of progress and successfully,
it just feels like such a

363
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,580
big mountain for them to go

364
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,030
James Clear: over.

365
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,110
For sure.

366
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,040
Yeah.

367
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,310
They're, um, so this is one
reason why I think starting with

368
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,390
small habits is so incredibly
important because a lot of the

369
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:03,090
time when we think about the
outcome that you want, so just

370
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,100
to continue your weight loss
or exercise example, yeah.

371
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,150
Everybody gets wrapped up in like,
oh, I wanna lose a hundred pounds,

372
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,610
or I wanna, you know, lose 20
pounds or whatever the number is.

373
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:15,795
Uh, but you forget about, they're
like all these little logistical

374
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:19,815
and emotional details that come
along with starting a new habit.

375
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,205
Yeah.

376
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:23,115
So, you know, I'll often tell the
story about, I have this reader

377
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,415
who he ended up losing over a
hundred pounds and, uh, one of the

378
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:29,085
first things he did was he went to
the gym, but he wasn't allowed to

379
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,675
stay for longer than five minutes.

380
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:31,485
So, okay.

381
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:35,085
He drove to the gym, got outta
the car, did half an exercise, got

382
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:38,685
back in the car, drove home, and
it sounds ridiculous to people.

383
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:41,175
It sounds silly because
it's like, well, clearly

384
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,665
exercising for five minutes
is not gonna get you in shape.

385
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:47,445
Like, that's not, but what you
realize is he was mastering

386
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:48,825
the art of showing up, right.

387
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:52,065
He was becoming the type of person
that drove to the gym every day.

388
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:52,425
Yeah.

389
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:54,735
And when you're in
that state, right.

390
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,735
For him, at that point, that
was the biggest shift was can

391
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,585
I, can I just become the type
of person who gets in here?

392
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:00,795
Right?

393
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:04,005
Who overcomes the uncertainty
or feeling uncomfortable

394
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,025
or feeling judged.

395
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,775
And all those things are very
real hurdles to building a habit.

396
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:11,535
You know, like there's, there
are all these little questions

397
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:13,215
that need to be answered
for something like that.

398
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,315
Like, okay, I want
to go to the gym.

399
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,415
Well, what time am I gonna go?

400
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,035
Am I gonna go before
work or after work?

401
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:19,395
Yeah.

402
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,685
What gym will I go to?

403
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,815
What route am I gonna
take to get there?

404
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:24,945
Do I need to bring a water bottle?

405
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,685
Or is there like a water
fountain at the gym?

406
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:27,135
Yeah.

407
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:30,795
And all those little questions
like that, like, you know,

408
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:33,465
whether or not you, uh, there's
a water fountain at the gym.

409
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:36,885
It sounds small, but if you
already feel uncomfortable and

410
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:39,495
feel like you don't belong, and
then you always forget to bring

411
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,475
your water bottle and you're
like, oh, there's nothing ever and

412
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:43,905
there's never anything to drink
there, that's enough friction to

413
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,165
get you to quit in the beginning.

414
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:45,465
Yeah.

415
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,925
So starting with
something simple like.

416
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,445
All I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna show up and I'm gonna

417
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,875
do one exercise for five
minutes and then I'm gonna go.

418
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:52,995
Mm-hmm.

419
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:56,295
Um, that I think is
a good way to start.

420
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:59,625
And it reminds me of what
Steven Pressfield wrote.

421
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,995
I think it was in the War of
Art, where he said something to

422
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:04,845
the effect of like, if you sit
down each day at the computer

423
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:08,085
and you do your writing, at
some point, at first it feels

424
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,935
uncomfortable, but at some point
that becomes your territory.

425
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:14,865
And I really like that phrasing
of it, because for an animal,

426
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:18,765
for a wolf or something, a,
a plate, a piece of land does

427
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,275
not become their territory
unless they spend time in it.

428
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:22,395
Mm-hmm.

429
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:22,785
Right?

430
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:23,835
Unless they're there each day.

431
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:24,275
Yeah.

432
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,655
It has to become comfortable first.

433
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:30,315
And so for many people building
habits, whether that's getting

434
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:33,135
into the gym or going to the yoga
studio, or sitting your butt in

435
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,185
the chair and writing, you need
to make that space your territory.

436
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:40,245
And at the very first step
is not getting a result.

437
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,030
It's spending time there.

438
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,120
Mm-hmm.

439
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,410
It's making that little bit of
land a zone where you feel like

440
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,880
this is where I belong each day.

441
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:48,110
Yeah.

442
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,260
And, uh, and that, that's a
big emotional hurdle to cross

443
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,170
before you even worry about
any of the physical or like

444
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,670
actual technical things to do.

445
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:56,671
Yeah.

446
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,450
Justin Jackson: Yeah.

447
00:18:57,455 --> 00:19:01,500
And I mean, the other thing that
helped, uh, is I went with my wife

448
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:08,550
and, uh, it's funny 'cause I felt
like, you know, I'm like, uh, Mr.

449
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,550
Confident, but she, she was like,
at one point she's like, Justin,

450
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,680
you are so nervous right now.

451
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,320
Like, she could tell
how nervous I was.

452
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,810
And I thought I was like
keeping it all together.

453
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,580
And it just reminded me of
like, I'd been in gyms from

454
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,340
the time I was in grade nine
all the way through college.

455
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,610
It wasn't like it was
unfamiliar, but I was nervous.

456
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:32,025
Because I was unfamiliar.

457
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:36,525
I, there had been a seven year gap
and now I was like exploring this

458
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:40,155
again, worried about what these
people are, are thinking about me.

459
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:42,915
Wow, that guy looks like
he's way more fit than me.

460
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,555
You know, like all these
thoughts go through your head.

461
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:51,945
And so, um, yeah, I think kind
of figuring out how you can like,

462
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:56,085
make a step and sometimes maybe
it's like going with somebody so

463
00:19:56,085 --> 00:20:00,315
you at least have some emotional,
'cause it's emotional, it's

464
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,855
nice to have someone to kind
of share the emotional burden.

465
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:04,275
James Clear: Right.

466
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:05,085
For sure.

467
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:09,855
Well, if you come, the thing that,
um, ultimately what you're looking

468
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,065
to do is, like we just said, feel
like it's part of your territory.

469
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:13,125
Yeah.

470
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:16,575
And because there are other people
in that space, what that also

471
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,185
means is you're looking to feel
like you're part of the tribe.

472
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:19,455
Yes.

473
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:20,205
Who goes there, right.

474
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:23,355
That you, you belong with the
other people who are in that room.

475
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:23,865
Yeah.

476
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:27,675
And, uh, so it helps to
What, what is a tribe?

477
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,775
Well, it's a group of people
that you get along with,

478
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:33,165
that you bond with, that you
belong to over something else.

479
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:33,255
Yeah.

480
00:20:33,255 --> 00:20:34,545
Over some shared interest.

481
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:38,235
And in other words, it's a group
in a lot of ways of friends.

482
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:39,915
Friends who share
some kind of interest.

483
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:41,385
So these are your gym friends?

484
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:41,655
Yeah.

485
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:45,000
Well, If you go with your
wife, then you automatically

486
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,180
have at least one person in
the tribe that you are friends

487
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,590
with, that you do belong with.

488
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:49,680
Yeah.

489
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,280
Um, and so I think that helps you
get over that hurdle a little bit.

490
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,370
You're not, you're no longer
facing that challenge alone.

491
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,970
You know, before it was like,
I am trying to get fit now.

492
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,210
It is.

493
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,770
We are trying to get fit.

494
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,070
Yeah.

495
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,360
And, uh, that, that helps a lot
with the kind of the mental feeling

496
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,890
of like, do I belong or not?

497
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,460
Yeah.

498
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,980
Justin Jackson: I've also
found, sorry, I don't mean

499
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,510
to stay on this too long, but
it's so fresh that the other

500
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:18,840
thing I found myself doing,
because I'm interested in the

501
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,300
emotional friction behind habits.

502
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:21,720
Mm-hmm.

503
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,170
And so the other thing I was
doing is I was going in there

504
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,150
and I'm uncomfortable, so I'm
trying to act really tough,

505
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,980
but I'm not tough at all.

506
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,100
I'm like, but I'm, you know, when
people look at me, I'm kind of like

507
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,060
scowling when like, I'm not being
friendly, I'm not being myself.

508
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,675
And, um, I was thinking about that
and thinking like, when you're

509
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:49,575
kind of inward focused and you're
in a new environment and you're

510
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,785
trying to develop a new habit, but
you're inward focused, it really

511
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,875
is, um, it, it doesn't really help.

512
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:57,915
And so I had to kind of turn
that around and go, okay, I

513
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:58,935
gotta start being friendly.

514
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:01,095
I gotta start saying
hi to these people.

515
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:01,305
Mm-hmm.

516
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:05,175
Because if I wave at this person
and it feels good, like they,

517
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:06,885
they respond with a smile.

518
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:09,255
And that happens again next time.

519
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:10,515
And again, next time.

520
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:13,425
That's a little bit
of a reward for me.

521
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:15,375
That's gonna keep
me going to the gym.

522
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:17,355
But if I keep going here
with this like tough.

523
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:19,125
Scowl on my face.

524
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:25,185
I, you know, and it's hard 'cause
you feel, you, you feel like you

525
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:28,695
don't belong, you feel nervous
and it, you kind of default to

526
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,795
these old, these weird behaviors.

527
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:35,355
But I, and it took a little
bit of time, but I've realized,

528
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,945
okay, I gotta, now I gotta get
in the habit of, of smiling and

529
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:41,685
saying hello when I'm in the gym.

530
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:45,045
Not just being like in my
own zone and pretending I'm,

531
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:46,635
you know, somebody I'm not.

532
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:46,995
James Clear: Right.

533
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:49,065
Well that's one thing that
kind of helps you start to

534
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:51,525
belong with the rest or become
part of the rest of the tribe.

535
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:54,315
You know, like just a friendly
behavior helps you start to

536
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:56,715
develop friendships with some of
those other people that are there.

537
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:57,615
Yeah, there was a.

538
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,360
A study that I wanted to
cite in Atomic Habits, but

539
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,940
I could, I couldn't find it
to track it down, but I read

540
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,990
about it years ago where,
um, the Y M C A ran a survey.

541
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,320
Yeah.

542
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,500
And when they surveyed people
who were joining the gym.

543
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,530
Okay.

544
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,980
The thing that got them to
join were, uh, the different

545
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,650
classes offered the equipment
that was in the gym.

546
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,080
Basically facilities and
features were the things that

547
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,670
got people in for the first time.

548
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,180
Yeah.

549
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,490
But then when they surveyed
members who had been there for

550
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,490
over a year, the thing that
got people to stick, nobody

551
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,080
mentioned features or facilities.

552
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,790
Everybody mentioned friendships.

553
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,090
Yes.

554
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,330
And so the people who actually
stayed at the gym or kept their

555
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:36,240
membership were the ones who
ended up developing friendships

556
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,200
with other people there.

557
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,530
Yeah.

558
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,700
And I think you're right.

559
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,830
Ultimately, the thing that
gets you to come back is

560
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,330
like, do I enjoy coming here?

561
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,160
Does it mean I get to
see some of my friends?

562
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,560
Does it mean I get to hang
out with people I like or.

563
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:49,110
You know, uh, it's really
the sense of belonging

564
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,550
that gets habits to stick.

565
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,959
Um, and the, the action itself
is just kind of like something

566
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:55,800
that's happening along the

567
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,100
Justin Jackson: way.

568
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:56,790
Yes.

569
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,030
But there's a, a, a, a step before
that that we kind of skipped over,

570
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,541
which is like, how do you even
choose a habit in the first place?

571
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,040
Like how does, how does that
happen in the sense of I might

572
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:15,179
not know what's good for me, so
what, how does that come into this?

573
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:15,959
James Clear: Yeah.

574
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,540
Well there are a lot of ways to
answer that question, so I'll

575
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,820
just share a couple thoughts
that are, that come to mind.

576
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,330
So I.

577
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:24,375
The first thought that comes to
mind is this question from, uh,

578
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,625
I first heard from Seth Godin,
which I think is just a great

579
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,455
question, which is, what is it for?

580
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:28,875
Mm-hmm.

581
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,935
Um, and so this is a question
that we need to ask ourselves when

582
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:34,995
we're trying to build a new habit,
which is, what is this habit for?

583
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:37,305
What is the, what am I actually
trying to achieve here?

584
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:37,455
Mm-hmm.

585
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:41,265
Because the correct habit to
choose is very different based on

586
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:44,565
what your goals are, what you're
hoping to get as an outcome,

587
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:45,865
what kinda lifestyle you want.

588
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:46,225
Mm-hmm.

589
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,995
Um, and you know, so for
example, the habit of

590
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:51,405
making 20 sales calls a day.

591
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:55,695
Well, if what it's for is
to increase revenue and to

592
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,274
build a successful business,
that's a wonderful thing.

593
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,665
Mm-hmm.

594
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:02,564
If you hate making sales calls
and you wanna spend less time

595
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:04,814
working and more time with
your family, that could be

596
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:05,895
a terrible habit to build.

597
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:06,014
Yeah.

598
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,605
It just depends on what it's for.

599
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:07,665
Yeah.

600
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:13,064
So, uh, that's one question
to ask, but you are correct

601
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:16,544
that we often don't know, uh,
what we need in the moment.

602
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:17,085
Mm-hmm.

603
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:19,784
And I think part of that's
just a challenge of life and a

604
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,475
challenge of self-awareness and,
you know, knowing what you need.

605
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:27,615
But life is a very complex
system and so figuring out

606
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,284
the right thing for that is
sometimes it's just impossible

607
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:31,425
or too many moving parts.

608
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:31,514
Yeah.

609
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:36,645
So, uh, I tend to default
to two possible answers.

610
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:40,485
The first answer is we all
need things that are so boring

611
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:43,034
that we don't think about them,
but are incredibly important

612
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:44,085
for showing up each day.

613
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:44,235
Yeah.

614
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:44,985
So I.

615
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,620
Did you sleep eight hours?

616
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,150
Are you drinking enough water?

617
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,700
Are you spending a little bit
of time walking outside or

618
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,050
getting a little bit of sunlight?

619
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,330
Um, do you exercise consistently?

620
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,940
Whatever form is
interesting to you mm-hmm.

621
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:59,790
Um, are you spending some time
reading and soaking up new ideas?

622
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,190
Now, I'm not saying you have
to do all that stuff every day.

623
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:02,520
Yeah.

624
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,030
But my point is like, those
are things that most people

625
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,920
would be like, yeah, of
course you should sleep and

626
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,150
read more books and exercise.

627
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,170
Everybody knows that's good.

628
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,470
Yeah.

629
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,580
But your time is almost never
going to be wasted by making

630
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,050
sure you do one of those things.

631
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,230
Yeah.

632
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,650
Right.

633
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,440
It's a, it's a fundamental
that's worth spending time on.

634
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,700
That's worth coming back to.

635
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,130
That's worth reminding
yourself of even if you

636
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,310
aren't sure the ideal perfect
place to focus in your life.

637
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:26,790
Yeah.

638
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,730
So that's the first answer,
come back to the fundamentals.

639
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,540
The second answer
is, uh, more broad.

640
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,820
I can't, I can't be specific
with it 'cause it depends on

641
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,570
each person, but the broad
application is what I would

642
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,580
call broad funnel type filter.

643
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:45,659
So whenever you're trying to figure
out where to focus, you need a

644
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,790
really broad range of research.

645
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,199
Try to get as many options as
possible, then apply a really

646
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:55,740
tight, strict filter to it and
just focus on the one or two

647
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,000
best options that you found.

648
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:57,030
Okay.

649
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,189
So for example, I just finished,
uh, atomic Habits a few months

650
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:04,560
ago, so now I'm thinking,
should I write a second book?

651
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:06,270
If I should, what
should that be about?

652
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,659
You know?

653
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:06,719
Yeah.

654
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,959
And I don't know right now,
so I'm in the broad funnel

655
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:12,780
stage, so I wanna lay out
as many options as possible.

656
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,729
I wanna brainstorm
a thousand titles.

657
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:17,070
I wanna look at all the
top books on Amazon.

658
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,860
I wanna browse my best
performing tweets and see

659
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,110
if there's a possible thread
for a book idea in there.

660
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:22,229
Mm-hmm.

661
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:25,439
I wanna look everywhere I can and
just list all of that stuff in the

662
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:27,120
same spreadsheet, and maybe I got.

663
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:30,105
1200 ideas on there,
really broad funnel.

664
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:33,314
But then I need to apply
a very tight filter.

665
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:36,195
Is this something I'm interested
in enough to spend two or

666
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:37,605
three or four years working on?

667
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:37,754
Mm-hmm.

668
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:41,115
Is it a topic of broad
appeal to a general audience?

669
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:43,125
Are there gonna be a lot
of people that like this?

670
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:43,514
Yeah.

671
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:46,695
Is this something that people,
that I can actually turn

672
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:47,955
into something actionable?

673
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:50,175
You know, like, can people
use this in their daily life?

674
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:54,405
Is this a topic that has a lot of
stories that I could tell, right?

675
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:56,745
Can I actually make this
entertaining or, you know, LA

676
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:59,534
latch onto other interesting
stories to make the book readable?

677
00:27:59,595 --> 00:27:59,955
Yes.

678
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:02,385
So, and you know, and those
are just some of the filters,

679
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:05,310
but there're my point is
that, You want some period

680
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,929
of very broad exploration.

681
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,629
And then once you have a lot of
options, you wanna really tighten

682
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:11,580
it down based on that question.

683
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,600
What is this for?

684
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:12,750
Yeah.

685
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,989
So in my case, the question
I'm using is, well, it's for

686
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,659
writing a good book, one that's
highly actionable, one that

687
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,750
sells a lot of copies, one that
people find useful and so on.

688
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,169
Yeah.

689
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:25,649
And um, so I think if you combine
that broad funnel type filter

690
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:29,159
strategy and that question of
what is it for that can maybe give

691
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,600
you some more specific answers.

692
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:30,689
Mm-hmm.

693
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:33,300
But even if you don't come up
with something good there, you can

694
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:34,679
always focus on the fundamentals.

695
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:35,129
Justin Jackson: Yeah.

696
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:39,929
And the other thing, when you
mentioned Seth Godin, uh, he has

697
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:44,639
this other line, which is People
like us do things like this.

698
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,050
James Clear: I love that line.

699
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,969
I wish I had thought
it up, but I Yeah.

700
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:48,689
Yeah.

701
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:49,199
It's so good.

702
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:52,620
Justin Jackson: It's such a
great like, mantra and it, what's

703
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:59,190
interesting about it is like,
for me, One thing that made me

704
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,390
start thinking about healthy
habits was hanging out with

705
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,280
people who had healthy habits.

706
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:05,550
Mm-hmm.

707
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:11,100
And, and in some ways it was
really lucky and fortunate,

708
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:16,710
like, um, you know, like, you
guys invited me to that retreat.

709
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:17,280
You dead.

710
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,060
Yep.

711
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,690
And in some ways I'm thankful
you guys invited a loser like me.

712
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,100
'cause I was like, I hanging
out in that group, you know,

713
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,320
I came and at first I was
cynical and grumpy and um, and

714
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,230
eventually, you know, just looking
around that group, I realized,

715
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,240
man, these people like this.

716
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,610
Do things like this and my
cynicism, which before would've

717
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,770
been like, wow, people like
that do stuff like that.

718
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,250
You know, it, it went down
and then all of a sudden I

719
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,820
was like, okay, well if people
like this, do things like

720
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,280
this, that's what I need to do.

721
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,200
And I think.

722
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,995
Uh, for folks that are, you know,
thinking like, okay, well how

723
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:00,945
do I know what good habits are?

724
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:08,985
There are so many things that
I would've never been, um, you

725
00:30:08,985 --> 00:30:10,125
know, uh, what do you call it?

726
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,585
There's like the, there's the
stages of habits or whatever,

727
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:16,755
but I would've never even had the
cue if I had not first observed

728
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:19,005
it and then noticed like, oh
wait, they're doing that, they're

729
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:20,235
doing that, they're doing that.

730
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:22,185
I'm the odd man out.

731
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:22,995
Yeah.

732
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:27,165
And that's what motivated
me to want to, to pursue

733
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:28,185
some of that stuff.

734
00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:30,735
But if I hadn't been in that
group and felt like, wait,

735
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:34,545
wait a second, like if I wanna
belong here, I gotta, I've

736
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:36,495
gotta, I gotta up my game.

737
00:30:36,555 --> 00:30:36,915
Right?

738
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,135
Um, it would've never happened.

739
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:42,795
And so people like us do
things like this has been

740
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:44,145
really helpful for me.

741
00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:45,165
James Clear: Yeah.

742
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,245
I love that phrase.

743
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,345
And one of the reasons I said
that, oh, I wish I had thought

744
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:52,365
that up, is because I think
it applies so deeply to a lot

745
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:53,865
of the ideas in atomic habits.

746
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:54,885
It applies to.

747
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,980
Um, how socially
reinforced our habits are.

748
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,040
Yeah.

749
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,440
I think this is, you know, I,
I wrote about this in the book.

750
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,700
I mean, I have a
whole chapter on it.

751
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,110
Chapter nine is all about that.

752
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:04,440
Yeah.

753
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,640
But I think I still undersold
the importance of how socially

754
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,900
reinforced our habits are.

755
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,080
Mm-hmm.

756
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,430
Um, and then it also references
this, uh, the importance

757
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,690
of a shared identity.

758
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,530
I think that ultimately a
shared identity is really one

759
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,960
of the most powerful forces
for getting habits to stick.

760
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,080
Mm-hmm.

761
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:26,010
You know, like if you look
at, um, if you look at it in a

762
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,310
big way, you can look at like
religions, you know, people,

763
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,370
religions are really interesting
places to look for habits.

764
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:32,610
Mm-hmm.

765
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:36,270
People get in the habit of going
to church every Sunday for.

766
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,740
50 years.

767
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:37,980
Yeah.

768
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,129
Largely because it's
reinforced the other people

769
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:42,300
in their neighborhoods go.

770
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,560
The people on their block, uh,
go, they see their friends there.

771
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,110
They, it's a very
socially reinforced habit.

772
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:49,290
Yes.

773
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,530
Um, same thing is
true in smaller ways.

774
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,440
Like let's say you move into a
new house and you walk outside

775
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,409
on Tuesday night and you see
all your, uh, neighbors have

776
00:31:58,409 --> 00:31:59,610
their recycling bins out.

777
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,820
Yeah.

778
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,720
And you're like, huh.

779
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,669
People like us do things like this.

780
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,590
Like people who live
in this neighborhood

781
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,820
recycle on Tuesday nights.

782
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:05,909
Yes.

783
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,409
I guess we need to
sign up for recycling.

784
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,250
And there are really
almost an infinite range of

785
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,629
examples that are like that.

786
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:13,980
Both large and small.

787
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,340
Yeah.

788
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,200
Where our habits are.

789
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,910
We notice them because the
people around us are doing

790
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,520
them, which is what the Q
portion is, you referenced.

791
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:21,610
Yeah.

792
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,890
We desire to do them.

793
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,830
We crave to follow through
on them because by doing the

794
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,730
same, we fit in or signal to
the other people around us.

795
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,480
Hey, I get it.

796
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,740
I'm part of the tribe too.

797
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,130
Yeah.

798
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,120
Um, it becomes easier to
do it because sometimes you

799
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,280
have friends helping you
out, you know, like it's like

800
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,780
having a spotter at the gym.

801
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:40,930
Yeah.

802
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,290
Like, oh, people like us help
each other out when a set is hard.

803
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,590
Yeah.

804
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,520
Um, and then ultimately it
becomes satisfying because, uh,

805
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,530
you enjoy being praised for it.

806
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,570
You know, other people are
like, Hey, it was great to

807
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,740
see you at church on Sunday.

808
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:53,860
Yeah.

809
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,350
Or, you know, really good
job on that workout today.

810
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,730
Um, and that feels good to
be praised for fitting in.

811
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,090
Yeah.

812
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:06,910
And so in that way, socially
reinforced habits or, um, the

813
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,320
collective identity, it hits all
four stages of habit formation.

814
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,890
Yeah.

815
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,080
Um, And I, I knew that when
I was writing it, but I

816
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,110
don't think I gave it as much
importance as I should have.

817
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,060
It, it's a very powerful
driver of behavior

818
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,629
Justin Jackson: in the long run.

819
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,439
Yeah, totally.

820
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:30,330
And I think this is why cynicism
is such a toxic, uh, attitude

821
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:36,659
and you know, I'm, I guess I'm
in Gen X, I'm born in 1980.

822
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:40,739
There's a lot of cynicism in
Gen X, and then millennials also

823
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:42,179
have a little bit of this too.

824
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,169
And I think, um, and actually
to be honest, everybody has it.

825
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:49,080
Baby boomers have it when, you
know, if you're a 50 year old

826
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,070
programmer and you're, you get
hired at a startup where the

827
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:58,379
c e O is 20 years old and we
kind of default to cynicism.

828
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:03,765
And it, it, it's such a
blocker when you're like

829
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:05,475
trying to observe those norms.

830
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:07,725
Like, oh wait, like people
like us do things like this.

831
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:11,355
Cynicism allows you to go,
well, yeah, people like that.

832
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,435
Do stuff like that.

833
00:34:12,435 --> 00:34:12,495
I.

834
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,610
That's good for them,
that's good for James.

835
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,330
Clear.

836
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,389
But you know, that's
not good for me.

837
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:25,320
And, uh, what I'm trying to, um,
kind of reveal from my experience

838
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,650
for anyone that ever watches this
or listens to this, is that you

839
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:34,770
really do need to step outside that
and at least be open to this idea

840
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,530
that your life could get better.

841
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,900
And it could just be going, okay,
well I'm gonna, I'm gonna vote

842
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,420
for who I'm gonna be today and I'm
gonna vote for who I'm gonna be

843
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,639
tomorrow and I'm gonna keep going.

844
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,670
The other thing in the book
that really helped me, and

845
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,860
I, I'm probably gonna butcher
it so you clean up after I do

846
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,170
it, but you show this grid.

847
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,770
So imagine like on this
side of your day, it's like,

848
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,120
okay, I make a good decision.

849
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,420
So it goes up and then I make
another good decision, goes up,

850
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,160
but then I make a bad decision.

851
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,520
Like I eat a tub of ice cream and.

852
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:10,905
You know, sometimes eating
the tub of ice cream is

853
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:13,545
like de debilitating.

854
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,825
It's like, well, I'm done.

855
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:17,445
I, I ate the tub of ice cream.

856
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:19,035
I suck at this.

857
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:21,405
I'm just gonna go get into
bed and forget about it.

858
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:25,155
And in your grid, you show,
wait, but you're still up here.

859
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:28,695
Like you can just make
another good decision and

860
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:29,715
then you're back up again.

861
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:30,285
Mm-hmm.

862
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:33,705
And I like that idea of kind
of navigating your ideas, not

863
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:35,535
being so hard on ourselves.

864
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:36,735
Did, did I kind of get that right?

865
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:38,265
James Clear: Yeah.

866
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:40,785
I, um, so this is the, I
don't know if you can see

867
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:41,865
it, but this is the image.

868
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:42,375
Oh, yeah.

869
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,445
Yeah.

870
00:35:42,885 --> 00:35:48,030
But it's, it's, uh, It's this idea
that like the difference between

871
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,360
a good day and a bad day is often
just a series of choices, right?

872
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,370
Yeah.

873
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,610
And you can win each
little moment, right?

874
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:55,530
You can win each decisive moment.

875
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,720
Just because you ate the tub
of ice cream doesn't mean you

876
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,890
can't win the next moment.

877
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,130
Yes.

878
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,170
Um, and uh, and so one thing
that I was thinking about when

879
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,320
I wrote that is this concept
that I call decisive moments.

880
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,680
Um, this idea that there are
a few choices each day, maybe

881
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,010
somewhere between say five
and 10, that kind of determine

882
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,420
the next chunk of time.

883
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,170
And so, so for example, there's a
moment for me each morning where

884
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,880
I sit down and either I open up
Evernote and I start writing the

885
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,230
next article I'm gonna work on.

886
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:25,320
Mm-hmm.

887
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,830
Or I go to E S P N and I
check the latest sports news.

888
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:28,920
Yeah.

889
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:29,880
And.

890
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,260
What happens in the next hour is
really determined by what happens

891
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,940
in like the first 45 seconds.

892
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,120
Yes.

893
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,940
You know, like, do I, do I go to
Evernote or do I go to E S P N?

894
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,110
And uh, so that is a decisive
moment in my language.

895
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,690
That's like a moment that
determines if I can master those

896
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,200
45 seconds, then I can end up
mastering the next hour that comes

897
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,700
afterward almost automatically.

898
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:50,970
Yeah.

899
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,950
Um, same thing is true.

900
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,830
There's a moment each night,
like five 15 or so, my wife gets

901
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,340
home from work and either we
change into our workout clothes

902
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,240
or we like sit on the couch and
watch reruns to the office and

903
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:04,410
order Indian food or whatever.

904
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:04,620
Yeah.

905
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,580
And both of those nights are
good nights, but the moment

906
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,310
to master is do we change into
our workout clothes or not?

907
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:11,400
Yeah.

908
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,770
If we do that, it only
takes a few minutes.

909
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,320
Everything else for the next
two hours is already decided.

910
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,930
We'll get in the car, we'll drive
to the gym, we'll do the reps.

911
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,270
Like it's all, it's all pretty
much done at that point.

912
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,600
Yeah.

913
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,230
So the reason I like bringing
that up or like thinking about

914
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:30,225
that is, You start to realize
there really isn't that much

915
00:37:30,285 --> 00:37:31,515
that you need to master.

916
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:31,815
Yeah.

917
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:34,305
Really you just are trying
to focus your attention

918
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,425
on a few key decisive
moments throughout the day.

919
00:37:37,425 --> 00:37:40,215
It's kind of like applying
judo to your life.

920
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:40,455
You know?

921
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,275
It's like apply the pressure and
the leverage at just the right

922
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,335
point and then the next hour kind
of falls into place automatically.

923
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:46,665
Yeah.

924
00:37:46,755 --> 00:37:50,445
Um, and so I like that because
once you realize that, once

925
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:54,030
you kind of identify those high
leverage decision points, You

926
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:59,190
can organize your day and your
environment around those things.

927
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:02,310
You know, if I know that
those 45 seconds where I'm

928
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:05,610
choosing between Evernote or
E S P N is a real key moment.

929
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,480
Mm-hmm.

930
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:09,930
Well, I could install freedom
and then I could block E S P N

931
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:12,240
from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM mm-hmm.

932
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,670
And that takes care of that
decisive moment, and it

933
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,250
increases the odds that I'm
gonna open a note instead.

934
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,580
Yes.

935
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,180
Um, but anyway, so little
choices like that, that are

936
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,310
easier to make once you've
identified some of those

937
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:24,390
Justin Jackson: key
points of leverage.

938
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:24,750
Yeah.

939
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,230
And you talk about in the book,
like there's some tricks too where

940
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,630
you can make things automatic.

941
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,420
Um, like, uh, you talk about near
a, y'all buying, uh, A little

942
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,819
device that just shuts off his
internet every night at 10.

943
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:39,060
Yeah.

944
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,420
Yeah.

945
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:40,290
Outlet timer.

946
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:40,710
Yeah.

947
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,270
And that's what's brilliant about
that is like, it shuts it off.

948
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,340
Like, especially if it's in
the basement or whatever, like

949
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:49,950
you're not gonna go downstairs
and like fiddle around with it.

950
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,180
And then it's just, it's
just, that's what happens.

951
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,330
Right?

952
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:59,310
Uh, if you, like, if E S P N was
really killing you, you could just

953
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,960
cancel your cable subscription.

954
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,840
That might be a bit, but
then you would, you go to

955
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,009
watch e s, espn, you can't.

956
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:05,279
Right.

957
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,299
It's, it's done.

958
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:10,410
Um, by the way, you mentioned
this in the book too, but it's

959
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,400
so funny how certain people's,
uh, what, what is a trigger for

960
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,870
some people is not for others.

961
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:21,060
Like, PN for me is not a,
that's not a temptation at all.

962
00:39:21,065 --> 00:39:21,220
James Clear: Yeah.

963
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,620
It doesn't even
enter your worldview.

964
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,279
Doesn't enter

965
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:24,180
Justin Jackson: my worldview.

966
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:27,840
But it shows you how identity
is so much a part of this.

967
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,670
Like, if I was hanging
out with a bunch of Oilers

968
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,395
fans, Every single day.

969
00:39:31,395 --> 00:39:31,485
Mm-hmm.

970
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:34,065
And this happened in
the co-work office.

971
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:37,395
You know, there's a few people
and they're watching Oilers games,

972
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:40,185
you know, on, on their computers.

973
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:43,425
And I realized like, if I
wanna talk to them, I've gotta

974
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,645
start watching Oilers games.

975
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:44,884
Yeah.

976
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,730
Yeah, so people like us do
things like this and so I

977
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,820
started developing this habit
of watching Oilers games when

978
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,770
before I didn't even care.

979
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,140
James Clear: I think, I mean, I
think this is one of the reasons

980
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:58,590
why sports is so tribal, why
people get so emotional about it,

981
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,670
is that it becomes a connection
point for the relationships.

982
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,280
It's not even the, the
game is actually, no

983
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,240
one would ever say that.

984
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,520
'cause everybody acts like the game
is the thing that matters the most.

985
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:08,730
Yeah.

986
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,910
But in a weird way, it's kind of a
secondary thing, you know, really.

987
00:40:12,404 --> 00:40:16,485
Like, when I think back, for me,
sports is a way for my brother

988
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:19,365
and I to connect and for us to
have something to text about and

989
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:20,505
chat about throughout the week.

990
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:20,595
Yeah.

991
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,444
It's a thing that, you know,
it's a reason for my dad and I

992
00:40:23,444 --> 00:40:26,265
to get together in person and
to go to games and hang out and

993
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,715
like, it's, it's all the other
stuff that it provides that

994
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:32,085
makes it so deeply meaningful.

995
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:32,265
Yes.

996
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:34,965
Um, and then you, you know,
you end up assigning a lot of

997
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,515
that emotion to how the team
does on the field as well.

998
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:37,694
Yeah.

999
00:40:37,694 --> 00:40:39,765
And what the score is on
the scoreboard, but Yeah.

1000
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,585
Um, so yeah, you're, it's a
good example there on that

1001
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:44,715
Justin Jackson: topic then,
and this is Cory Stone is

1002
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,875
asking this in chat, but
there's a lot of people on

1003
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:47,895
Twitter that asked us too.

1004
00:40:49,095 --> 00:40:52,694
Given that example that you
just gave, if your meaningful

1005
00:40:52,694 --> 00:40:57,255
relationships are engaging in
habits that may might not be

1006
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:01,785
good for you or that you want to
change, how do you navigate that?

1007
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:06,194
So if you're really feeling like,
I gotta, I gotta stop watching

1008
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,045
sports, it's just like I get
a little bit and then I just.

1009
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,130
Go crazy, but I still wanna have
a relationship with my brother.

1010
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:14,220
Right.

1011
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,190
Uh, this is where it gets complex,
especially if you're married

1012
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,240
to somebody, like if your wife
is, is like your wife is at

1013
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,690
least somewhat inclined to wanna
go to the gym, I'm guessing.

1014
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,810
But if she was like, no,
I just wanna watch Netflix

1015
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,090
and order Indian food,
that's all I want to do.

1016
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:30,750
Yeah.

1017
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,310
How do you start to navigate those

1018
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:32,820
James Clear: things?

1019
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,634
Yeah, those are good questions.

1020
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:39,674
Um, I mean, it's really hard, uh,
because especially if it's a person

1021
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:43,035
who you want to stay in your life,
you know, I think, first of all,

1022
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:45,734
I just wanna say I, so I have some
things I want to add to this, but

1023
00:41:45,975 --> 00:41:51,165
I feel like, um, it's worth noting
that this question comes up a lot.

1024
00:41:51,404 --> 00:41:54,464
And I think the reason it
comes up a lot is because we

1025
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:57,944
all know that actually there
isn't a good, easy answer.

1026
00:41:57,944 --> 00:41:58,035
Mm-hmm.

1027
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:00,075
And that it's like just
a hard part of life.

1028
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:00,765
You know what I mean?

1029
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:03,044
Like everybody wants, it's
one of those things we want

1030
00:42:03,049 --> 00:42:05,984
to keep asking about in hopes
that, oh, maybe there'll be

1031
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,395
an easy way to resolve this.

1032
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:07,395
Yeah.

1033
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:09,915
But I think we all know,
like, it's, it's a challenge.

1034
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,305
Yeah.

1035
00:42:10,365 --> 00:42:13,545
Um, Now that said, there
are a few things you can do.

1036
00:42:13,545 --> 00:42:17,355
So first thing is, uh, sometimes
your friends and family want

1037
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:20,265
to do something different
than how you want to change.

1038
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:23,234
So like you're, you wanna
stick to a new diet, they

1039
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:24,315
want to eat the old way.

1040
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:24,464
Mm-hmm.

1041
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:26,265
Or, um, something like that.

1042
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:26,315
Yeah.

1043
00:42:26,595 --> 00:42:29,505
Well, uh, you want to start
doing yoga, they couldn't

1044
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,555
care less about yoga.

1045
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:31,845
They don't want to
go to class with you.

1046
00:42:31,935 --> 00:42:32,025
Yeah.

1047
00:42:32,055 --> 00:42:33,105
Um, things like that.

1048
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:37,395
Well, if that's the case, then
for certain habits, you don't

1049
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:40,875
have to like fire your friends
and family to be able to do that.

1050
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:44,044
But what you can, what you do
need, or what can be really

1051
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:47,975
useful is having like a sacred
space where that occurs.

1052
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:51,274
Where, I'm not saying you need
to do this with me, but just

1053
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:52,504
don't make it harder on me.

1054
00:42:52,564 --> 00:42:52,745
Right?

1055
00:42:52,745 --> 00:42:52,805
Yeah.

1056
00:42:52,805 --> 00:42:56,404
Just don't conflict with, so,
you know, the yoga example is an

1057
00:42:56,404 --> 00:42:59,104
easier one where it's like, well
you, maybe you need to go to a

1058
00:42:59,104 --> 00:43:03,004
yoga studio away from, uh, the
friends and family that aren't

1059
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:06,245
interested and start to build
friendships with people who are,

1060
00:43:06,395 --> 00:43:08,435
you know, I'm not saying you need
to get rid of your old friends,

1061
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:11,075
but maybe it'd be helpful to build
a couple new ones who are into

1062
00:43:11,075 --> 00:43:14,404
yoga so that you have like a safe
space for that habit to live.

1063
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:14,825
Yeah.

1064
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,024
Um, so that's one thing.

1065
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,470
Uh, then there's the second
piece, which is sometimes you're

1066
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:24,100
building a habit that you do
want the person to like join

1067
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,420
you on to come along with you.

1068
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,240
You know, you, you're working out
and you would love for your spouse

1069
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,440
to join you at the gym mm-hmm.

1070
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,790
Or something like that.

1071
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,750
And, uh, everybody know like
it would be good, but they

1072
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,660
feel maybe they feel less
comfortable there than you do.

1073
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,560
Or maybe they feel, you know, you,
uh, were previously an athlete

1074
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,920
and they were not, and so you feel
kind of comfortable in the gym.

1075
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:47,470
You've been there before in
years past, but for them it's

1076
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,600
like new and weird and, you
know, they feel like they're

1077
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,710
being judged and whatever.

1078
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,070
Mm-hmm.

1079
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,840
If you're dealing with a case like
that, The, the thing that I try to

1080
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,660
keep in mind, and I can tell you
from working with my own family,

1081
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,860
um, it can be incredibly useful is
praise the good, ignore the bad.

1082
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,100
Mm-hmm.

1083
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,930
Um, it's very hard to do.

1084
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,230
It's very, the, the difficult
part about it is not doing

1085
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,020
it on an individual basis,
it's that this needs to be

1086
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,340
the new lifestyle for you.

1087
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,430
Mm-hmm.

1088
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,850
So when they do the thing
that you're asking them to do.

1089
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,150
Yeah.

1090
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,000
Don't, basically, another
way to phrase this is don't

1091
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,640
criticize people for doing what
you were hoping they would.

1092
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:21,910
Yeah.

1093
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,690
You know, like there are so many
times when the introverted kid

1094
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,450
in the family will come down to
the dinner table and it's like,

1095
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,950
oh, look who decided to join us?

1096
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,230
And it's like, well, they
finally did the thing Yeah.

1097
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,460
That you were hoping they would
do and engage with everybody.

1098
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:36,730
Yeah.

1099
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,800
And now they just feel like
they're getting criticized for it.

1100
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:39,130
Yeah.

1101
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:39,400
Or.

1102
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,210
Um, you go to the gym and your
spouse decides to join you and

1103
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,339
they do a few sets, and then
they feel like they're done.

1104
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:47,520
Yeah.

1105
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,649
And you say, well, that
was a pretty short workout.

1106
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,640
And what you should should be
saying is, I think it's great

1107
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,810
that you got in here tonight.

1108
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,140
Right?

1109
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,200
Yeah.

1110
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,480
Like, you weren't feeling it, but
you were still able to make it in.

1111
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:57,960
Yeah.

1112
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,319
And.

1113
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,440
Um, so praise the
good, ignore the bad.

1114
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:01,500
Yeah.

1115
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,430
Uh, and if you can do that in the
long run, what ends up happening

1116
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,910
is everybody likes feeling praised.

1117
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,680
Everybody likes feeling rewarded.

1118
00:45:10,685 --> 00:45:14,940
They like to, it feels satisfying
to, uh, do something that the

1119
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,490
people who love you and who
are around you, praise you for.

1120
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,270
Mm-hmm.

1121
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,810
And so at first you go to the gym
and they say, Hey, I'm really proud

1122
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,710
of you for getting in here tonight.

1123
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,220
Good job.

1124
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:23,550
Yeah.

1125
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,840
And it doesn't seem like much.

1126
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,050
But then after two months and
three months and 10 months of

1127
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,140
that, you turn around a year
later, and they might never

1128
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:35,065
even say it, but implicitly
what they've realized is, Damn.

1129
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,045
Every time I go to
the gym it feels good.

1130
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:38,395
They like, they compliment me.

1131
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:38,725
Yeah.

1132
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:41,635
And that, so now all of a sudden
you start to associate going

1133
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:43,555
to the gym with feeling good.

1134
00:45:43,945 --> 00:45:46,105
And this is a really
long game play.

1135
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:46,195
Mm-hmm.

1136
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:49,525
Because it takes a while for
that to reinforce itself.

1137
00:45:49,885 --> 00:45:53,305
But, um, you know, same thing,
like the introverted kid at the

1138
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:56,905
table sits down and they say
something that happened today.

1139
00:45:56,905 --> 00:45:57,985
And it's like, oh, that's awesome.

1140
00:45:57,985 --> 00:45:59,125
Thanks for sharing that with us.

1141
00:45:59,155 --> 00:45:59,395
Yeah.

1142
00:45:59,395 --> 00:46:02,275
You know, and like on that
individual night, that one night

1143
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,785
at dinner doesn't count for a
lot, but if every time they speak

1144
00:46:05,785 --> 00:46:09,655
up, they're rewarded for it, then
all of a sudden now they have a

1145
00:46:09,655 --> 00:46:12,145
reason to start doing that more
in the months and years to come.

1146
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:12,505
Yeah.

1147
00:46:12,535 --> 00:46:15,685
So it takes a while, but I
think that that's like an

1148
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:18,175
effective way to gradually
nudge people in the right

1149
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:18,715
Justin Jackson: direction.

1150
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:19,255
Yeah.

1151
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:21,955
There's someone in the chat that's
saying they need to apply that

1152
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:25,315
idea to themself to avoid feeling
guilty for not doing enough.

1153
00:46:25,335 --> 00:46:25,395
Hm.

1154
00:46:25,905 --> 00:46:29,415
So instead of reinforce, oh,
you idiot, you didn't go to

1155
00:46:29,415 --> 00:46:30,795
the gym again, you're fatty.

1156
00:46:30,795 --> 00:46:32,655
You know, like that's not helpful.

1157
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:36,705
Uh, there's the self-talk, it
can work with self-talk as well.

1158
00:46:37,215 --> 00:46:39,855
James Clear: This is why I
think, uh, small habits can be

1159
00:46:39,855 --> 00:46:43,395
so useful in some ways, even on
the bad days because like, let's

1160
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,855
say you're in that situation you
just said where it's like, oh,

1161
00:46:45,915 --> 00:46:47,775
you know, skip the gym again.

1162
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:48,045
Yeah.

1163
00:46:48,045 --> 00:46:52,095
Well you can still do one pushup
or one air squat or whatever before

1164
00:46:52,095 --> 00:46:55,065
you go do a set of 10 air squats
before you hop in bed tonight.

1165
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:55,485
Mm-hmm.

1166
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:55,735
And.

1167
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,395
It is not gonna
transform your body.

1168
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:00,075
But that's not really the point.

1169
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:03,645
The point is to prove to yourself
that it wasn't a good day.

1170
00:47:03,705 --> 00:47:05,924
I didn't have the best
motivation or energy.

1171
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:09,315
I had a long day at work, but I
still am not the type of person

1172
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:10,725
who miss work misses workouts.

1173
00:47:10,725 --> 00:47:10,935
Right.

1174
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:10,995
Yeah.

1175
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:14,265
I still prove to myself,
I still cast a vote for

1176
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,315
being that kind of person.

1177
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:17,654
I didn't let a day go by
without doing nothing.

1178
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:18,134
Yeah.

1179
00:47:18,134 --> 00:47:21,585
And um, that can count
for a lot in the long run.

1180
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:25,395
And, uh, so sometimes small
habits are less about the outcome

1181
00:47:25,395 --> 00:47:28,305
they deliver and more about
the identity they reinforce.

1182
00:47:28,335 --> 00:47:28,725
Yeah.

1183
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:31,395
Justin Jackson: And I've
actually found, um, you know,

1184
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:38,055
another thing I, I try to, I'm
implementing in the new year is I

1185
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,975
decided to quit drinking alcohol.

1186
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:43,245
And right now it's
ostensibly for this goal

1187
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:44,475
of hitting a revenue mark.

1188
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:46,904
Once I hit the goal,
then I can have a drink.

1189
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:52,754
But the deeper motivation for
me was I just realized like, It

1190
00:47:52,754 --> 00:47:54,464
just makes, it's a depressant.

1191
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:58,095
It's like there's a bunch of
reasons that it's not good for me.

1192
00:47:58,365 --> 00:48:03,285
And so my, my excuse or my way of
trying it out is saying, well, I'm

1193
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:07,245
going for this goal, but it's been
interesting in social situations.

1194
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:10,214
'cause all of my friends still
drink and that's fine with me.

1195
00:48:10,694 --> 00:48:15,585
But, uh, in sometimes just sharing
the goal, oh, I'm just doing this

1196
00:48:15,585 --> 00:48:16,964
'cause I'm going after this thing.

1197
00:48:17,475 --> 00:48:21,525
And, and you talk about how goals
are sometimes helpful in setting

1198
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:25,125
your direction, you know, like,
okay, I'm pointed this way now.

1199
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:28,815
And, uh, sometimes sharing
that with people is helpful.

1200
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:31,634
The other thing is, I think
eventually if I just keep doing

1201
00:48:31,634 --> 00:48:35,535
this, I just, for me to say,
well, I'm a non-drinker now.

1202
00:48:36,315 --> 00:48:36,765
Yeah.

1203
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:42,345
And so I can still go and have,
uh, my favorite and it, it's also

1204
00:48:42,345 --> 00:48:44,025
nice having a thing that you like.

1205
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:48,705
So my favorite non-alcoholic drink
is a, a non-alcoholic Caesar.

1206
00:48:48,734 --> 00:48:50,055
It's a like a bloody Mary.

1207
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:54,194
And to have that drink,
it's like kind of spicy.

1208
00:48:54,734 --> 00:48:56,174
There's a reward there.

1209
00:48:56,595 --> 00:48:59,265
I also have this social
crutch that I can use in

1210
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:00,944
the situation, you know?

1211
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:05,835
And if somebody asks me about it, I
also have this new identity, which

1212
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,634
is, oh, I'm a non-drinker now.

1213
00:49:07,665 --> 00:49:08,415
I just don't drink.

1214
00:49:09,165 --> 00:49:12,044
And you talked about that there's
some research behind that.

1215
00:49:12,044 --> 00:49:14,595
I know you've mentioned it
a lot, but it's like, um,

1216
00:49:14,774 --> 00:49:17,325
I'm trying to quit smoking
versus I'm a non-smoker.

1217
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:17,745
Right.

1218
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:19,395
Is that correct?

1219
00:49:19,904 --> 00:49:20,355
Correct.

1220
00:49:20,355 --> 00:49:20,685
Right.

1221
00:49:20,774 --> 00:49:21,105
Yeah.

1222
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:21,106
Yeah.

1223
00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:24,285
So I think that that
can be really helpful.

1224
00:49:24,555 --> 00:49:25,095
Yeah.

1225
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:25,765
Having,

1226
00:49:26,225 --> 00:49:30,600
James Clear: um, I think what
you're explaining here, the

1227
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,460
situation that you're going
through, this experience

1228
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,700
you're having is kind of,
it's illustrating this process

1229
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,630
of identity change, right?

1230
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:36,750
Mm-hmm.

1231
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,480
It started with, oh, I'm just gonna
put it off for a little while,

1232
00:49:39,485 --> 00:49:40,830
while I'm attacking this goal.

1233
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,100
Yeah.

1234
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,920
But then you're casting so many
votes for like, you know what?

1235
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,020
I haven't dragged, and like,
I'm kind of benefiting from it.

1236
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,700
Like, maybe this is
part of my identity now.

1237
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:47,880
Yeah.

1238
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,930
Maybe I'm a non drinker.

1239
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,440
Um, and, uh, so anyway,
yeah, I I think you're

1240
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,040
definitely on the right

1241
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,490
Justin Jackson: track there.

1242
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:53,790
Yeah.

1243
00:49:53,795 --> 00:49:57,120
And actually this is a good time
to bring up two Twitter questions.

1244
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,990
Um, Maria Alre asks, um, you
know, how do you maintain habits?

1245
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,930
How, ask him about maintaining
habits for people with depression,

1246
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,030
anxiety, or attention deficit.

1247
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:11,145
Do you wanna try to tackle that?

1248
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:12,615
James Clear: Yeah.

1249
00:50:12,674 --> 00:50:16,904
Um, so I've tried to be careful
about saying that Atomic

1250
00:50:16,904 --> 00:50:19,634
Habits is about building habits
and breaking, breaking bad

1251
00:50:19,634 --> 00:50:20,654
habits, building good ones.

1252
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:22,694
Uh, but it's not a
book on addiction.

1253
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:23,984
It's not a book on depression.

1254
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:27,165
It's not a book about anxiety or
a D H D or any of these other,

1255
00:50:27,254 --> 00:50:28,815
um, disorders or ailments.

1256
00:50:28,845 --> 00:50:29,205
Mm-hmm.

1257
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:33,464
Um, and I don't consider
myself an expert on addiction.

1258
00:50:34,214 --> 00:50:35,955
However, something
interesting has happened.

1259
00:50:35,955 --> 00:50:39,674
So I published the, the
book and I have had a ton of

1260
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,875
speaking requests recently.

1261
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,725
And so I've been doing speeches
at conferences and companies and

1262
00:50:43,725 --> 00:50:44,714
different events and whatever.

1263
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,805
Yeah.

1264
00:50:45,465 --> 00:50:49,725
And so many times I get someone
that comes up to me afterward

1265
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:52,965
or that asks a question during
q and a that talks about how

1266
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:57,795
useful the book was for their son
who had a D H D or their cousin

1267
00:50:57,795 --> 00:51:00,615
was a meth addict, and then was
able to like start to, you know,

1268
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:03,375
write the ship by employing some
of these techniques or whatever.

1269
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:03,765
Yeah.

1270
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:04,904
Uh, which is great.

1271
00:51:04,904 --> 00:51:05,884
Which is very gratifying.

1272
00:51:06,134 --> 00:51:08,235
I still stand by my
original statement.

1273
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,615
I'm not an expert on addiction.

1274
00:51:09,615 --> 00:51:12,015
I don't want to like take a
strong stance of this stuff.

1275
00:51:12,075 --> 00:51:12,165
Mm-hmm.

1276
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:16,395
But what I've realized is that
the principles that I lay out

1277
00:51:16,395 --> 00:51:20,145
in atomic habits are really
about how human behavior works.

1278
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:21,915
It's about how habits are formed.

1279
00:51:21,975 --> 00:51:22,245
Yeah.

1280
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:24,945
And whether that habit is
something extreme like an

1281
00:51:24,945 --> 00:51:29,205
addiction or picking your skin
or O C D or A D H D or whatever.

1282
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:33,105
Um, or whether it's something
more moderate, like meditating

1283
00:51:33,105 --> 00:51:34,154
for three minutes a day.

1284
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:34,515
Yes.

1285
00:51:34,575 --> 00:51:39,345
Um, the fundamentals tend to be
similar and so I'm not gonna say

1286
00:51:39,345 --> 00:51:42,825
that the book offers a prescription
for overcoming addictions, but

1287
00:51:42,825 --> 00:51:46,455
what I will say is you'd be hard
pressed to find tactics in the

1288
00:51:46,455 --> 00:51:47,645
book that wouldn't at least help.

1289
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:48,205
Mm-hmm.

1290
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:48,585
Right.

1291
00:51:48,585 --> 00:51:50,654
That wouldn't at least nudge
people in the right direction.

1292
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:50,745
Yeah.

1293
00:51:51,134 --> 00:51:56,024
Um, I have heard from a few readers
who specifically have said that,

1294
00:51:56,115 --> 00:51:59,475
uh, they had a D H D and that
they found the book very helpful.

1295
00:51:59,654 --> 00:51:59,745
Mm-hmm.

1296
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:03,464
Um, environment design for whatever
reason has been something that's

1297
00:52:03,464 --> 00:52:05,955
come up multiple times for folks
who have struggled with that.

1298
00:52:05,984 --> 00:52:06,254
Yeah.

1299
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:09,555
So, you know, it's, I think it's
kind of like if you're the type

1300
00:52:09,555 --> 00:52:12,975
of person who is less likely
to just remember to do it.

1301
00:52:13,154 --> 00:52:13,245
Yeah.

1302
00:52:13,245 --> 00:52:13,515
Right.

1303
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:17,055
Or like, just follow your
to-do list if that's not you.

1304
00:52:17,174 --> 00:52:17,355
Yeah.

1305
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,895
Then structuring an environment
where it's easier to see the

1306
00:52:20,895 --> 00:52:22,424
cues of your good habits.

1307
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,705
Less likely to see
the distractions.

1308
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,319
Less friction between you and
the good behavior, more friction

1309
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,790
between you and the bad ones.

1310
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:30,029
Yeah.

1311
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:33,180
If you place yourself in that
space, it's much more likely

1312
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,230
that you're gonna fall through.

1313
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:34,950
So, yeah.

1314
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:37,080
You know, those are things
that I talk about in chapter

1315
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,350
six and 12, but I, I think
that the book applies.

1316
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,919
Um, but I, I don't pitch it as
like a prescription for someone

1317
00:52:43,924 --> 00:52:45,299
dealing with a more serious issue.

1318
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:45,870
Totally.

1319
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,140
Justin Jackson: Yeah.

1320
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,770
And I, I would say, um, again,
I'm not an expert either, but as

1321
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:53,549
someone who has been, uh, dealing
with depression the past couple

1322
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:59,910
years, uh, having a professional
that you go to that deals with

1323
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,149
this stuff all the time, like
a therapist is so helpful.

1324
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:08,609
And the therapist will
be very interested if

1325
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:09,839
you read James's book.

1326
00:53:10,049 --> 00:53:12,359
So I said to my therapist,
I'm like, you know, she

1327
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:13,799
starts way back here.

1328
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:16,350
And then, uh, she says,
so what's new with you?

1329
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,419
I'm like, well, you know,
I read this book and I'm

1330
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:20,279
thinking, oh, what are you
thinking about doing with that?

1331
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:24,075
Oh, I'm thinking about
maybe, um, quitting alcohol.

1332
00:53:24,105 --> 00:53:27,075
Oh, well that's, you know,
there, there's some reinforcement

1333
00:53:27,075 --> 00:53:28,335
from the professionals.

1334
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:29,025
Hmm.

1335
00:53:29,234 --> 00:53:33,464
And, uh, likewise with my, my
doctor, you know, when I, when

1336
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:38,415
I had depression and I went
to my physician, she said she

1337
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,674
gave me two prescriptions.

1338
00:53:40,185 --> 00:53:46,815
Um, quit drinking alcohol and quit,
uh, taking any kind of cannabis.

1339
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:52,004
And the reason is she says, those
are going to make you feel bad.

1340
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:54,705
Now, the trigger in
that case was my doctor.

1341
00:53:54,705 --> 00:53:56,444
It's nice when you have
a doctor saying, listen,

1342
00:53:56,565 --> 00:53:57,404
this is your prescription.

1343
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:59,535
Oh, and double the amount
of exercise I was doing.

1344
00:53:59,955 --> 00:54:05,865
So three things, those, so I did
that for three months and then,

1345
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:09,015
you know, I went back to my old
habits, but now I have that memory.

1346
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,890
Of what it was like
for three months.

1347
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:15,240
And it's been a powerful trigger
for me to, you know, when I am

1348
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,380
starting to notice my mood go down,
I can re, I remembered, you know,

1349
00:54:19,385 --> 00:54:23,940
my doctor's prescription was quit
drinking, quit, you know, eating

1350
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,180
edibles and doubling my exercise.

1351
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,190
And that's been helpful
for me personally.

1352
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,700
So I think if you're reading the
book, let your professional in

1353
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,280
your life know about it is good.

1354
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,570
One thing I want you to do is,
uh, 'cause I love the imagery,

1355
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,960
but, uh, and this is probably
unfair to you, is to give

1356
00:54:42,965 --> 00:54:45,930
the ice cube example, but use
Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.

1357
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,260
James Clear: So, um, this
is an example from the

1358
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,190
first chapter of the book.

1359
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:57,720
Um, and I actually, as a side
note, I thought about this.

1360
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,400
I was like, man, we're gonna
have to get these changed

1361
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,540
for the foreign editions.

1362
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,920
Like, we're gonna,
it's gonna need to be.

1363
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,870
But anyway, so yeah, you came.

1364
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:03,510
Yeah.

1365
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:03,960
Yeah.

1366
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:09,360
The, uh, The core idea is that the
process of changing your habits

1367
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:12,060
is, well, it's similar to what we
talked about early on, that there's

1368
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,690
often this valley of death, that
there's this period where you're

1369
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,510
just kind of building up latent
potential, but you're not really

1370
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,250
releasing any of the results yet.

1371
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:20,580
Yeah.

1372
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,180
And I like to equate it to the
process of heating up an ice cube.

1373
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,760
You know, so you've got,
you've got this ice cube

1374
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,140
sitting on the table, right?

1375
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,630
And so let's say it's like
negative three degrees in there.

1376
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:30,780
Yeah.

1377
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,080
Right?

1378
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,600
So you're, you're a negative three.

1379
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,350
It's cold.

1380
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,630
You can see your breath, the
ice cube's sitting there,

1381
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,810
you heat it up, negative
two, negative one, still,

1382
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:42,030
there's this ice cube sitting
there, nothing has happened.

1383
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:42,150
Yeah.

1384
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,510
Right.

1385
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,710
Um, then you go from negative
one to zero, and all of a sudden

1386
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,150
you have this one degree shift.

1387
00:55:48,465 --> 00:55:52,545
No different than any of the other
shifts that came before it, but you

1388
00:55:52,545 --> 00:55:54,285
have this phase transition, right?

1389
00:55:54,345 --> 00:55:56,205
And like the ice
cube starts melting.

1390
00:55:56,685 --> 00:55:59,775
And that, I think is
indicative of what it often

1391
00:55:59,775 --> 00:56:01,575
feels like to change a habit.

1392
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:03,825
You're making these little
improvements, you're trying to

1393
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:08,055
make these 1% changes, these
one degree shifts each day.

1394
00:56:08,235 --> 00:56:11,865
And you're like, it's really
easy to get, um, frustrated or

1395
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:13,125
even depressed at that point.

1396
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:13,275
You know?

1397
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,885
It's like, I've been running
for three weeks, how come I

1398
00:56:15,885 --> 00:56:17,175
can't see a change in my body?

1399
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:17,355
Yeah.

1400
00:56:17,355 --> 00:56:17,595
You know?

1401
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:20,115
Or I've been writing blog
posts for six months now.

1402
00:56:20,115 --> 00:56:21,795
How come this site
isn't popular yet?

1403
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:21,915
Mm-hmm.

1404
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:26,175
And the key point there is
your work was not being wasted.

1405
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,285
It's just being stored.

1406
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:27,645
Yeah.

1407
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:31,545
Complaining about sticking to
a habit for two months or three

1408
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:34,275
months, or even six months
or a year, and not having the

1409
00:56:34,275 --> 00:56:36,825
outcome that you want is kind
of like complaining about

1410
00:56:36,825 --> 00:56:39,255
heating the ice cube from
negative three to negative one

1411
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,785
degrees and it not melting yet.

1412
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:40,905
Yeah.

1413
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:43,185
You know, like the, the
work was not wasted.

1414
00:56:43,185 --> 00:56:44,175
It's just being stored.

1415
00:56:44,295 --> 00:56:45,555
And I love that quote.

1416
00:56:46,275 --> 00:56:49,755
That's in that same section
from Jacob Reese, who it

1417
00:56:49,755 --> 00:56:52,065
hangs in the locker room with
the San Antonio who've won

1418
00:56:52,065 --> 00:56:53,715
five N B A championships.

1419
00:56:53,835 --> 00:56:54,015
Yeah.

1420
00:56:54,045 --> 00:56:58,605
And it says, essentially when I
feel like giving up, I think about

1421
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:02,655
the stone cutter who continues
to hammer away at the stone a

1422
00:57:02,655 --> 00:57:06,345
hundred times without it splitting
and then finally on the hundred

1423
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:08,055
first blow it cracks in two.

1424
00:57:08,235 --> 00:57:08,385
Yeah.

1425
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,935
And I know that it wasn't
the hundred that came there.

1426
00:57:10,935 --> 00:57:13,155
I know it wasn't the hundred
first swing that did it, but the

1427
00:57:13,155 --> 00:57:14,685
hundred that came before, right?

1428
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:14,895
Yes.

1429
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:16,935
And like it's that same idea.

1430
00:57:16,995 --> 00:57:20,505
You know, the reason the site
takes off is not because of the

1431
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:24,045
one viral article, it's because
of the 55 that you wrote in

1432
00:57:24,045 --> 00:57:25,485
the weeks and months prior.

1433
00:57:25,665 --> 00:57:29,655
The reason that you see a change
in your body is not because today's

1434
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,425
workout radically transformed you.

1435
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:34,005
It's because you've been sticking
to it for eight months now.

1436
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:34,305
Yes.

1437
00:57:34,335 --> 00:57:35,835
Um, and it's really about.

1438
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,310
Showing up, continue to put those
swings in, continue to raise

1439
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,130
the temperature by one degree,
and eventually you hit that

1440
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,340
phase transition where you can
see the results of your work.

1441
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,030
Justin Jackson: Yeah.

1442
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,650
And that image has been
so powerful in my life.

1443
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,120
Uh, the rea, like I've been telling
people about this book, and, and

1444
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:59,660
I actually notice there's kind
of like a, a coffee shop test.

1445
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,480
Like if I hear people talking
about something from internet

1446
00:58:02,485 --> 00:58:06,980
culture in a coffee shop, like
real people, then something's hit

1447
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,890
and atomic habits is like that.

1448
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:16,760
Like it hit the, the, the kind
of mainstream and that image

1449
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,690
of just raising the temperature
a little bit every day.

1450
00:58:21,555 --> 00:58:26,714
Now I feel like I'm, I'm a
few months into this and uh,

1451
00:58:27,464 --> 00:58:32,415
I'm a little bit kind of like,
uh, evangelical about it.

1452
00:58:32,415 --> 00:58:37,634
Like I'm saying now, I'm like, God,
like my life is so much better and

1453
00:58:37,725 --> 00:58:41,685
it's because of just these little
changes over time in the same

1454
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,865
direction I can now I can see it.

1455
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:47,535
Now I can see that I
feel better, you know?

1456
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,845
Wow, man, quitting alcohol,
that was one thing.

1457
00:58:49,845 --> 00:58:52,424
And then wow, showing up at
the gym three or four times

1458
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:53,504
a week, that really helps.

1459
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:54,165
And wow.

1460
00:58:54,169 --> 00:58:56,415
Like reading a real book every
night before I go to bed.

1461
00:58:56,714 --> 00:59:02,085
All of these things keep kinda
adding up and do make a meaningful

1462
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:03,285
difference in your life.

1463
00:59:03,615 --> 00:59:06,194
Even though way back when, when
you're starting, you feel like,

1464
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:07,484
well, nothing's gonna help.

1465
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:08,970
Me now.

1466
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,299
Mm-hmm.

1467
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:14,460
Uh, it's, I, I, I wanna be clear
that this, these ideas have

1468
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:16,350
meaningfully impacted my life.

1469
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:17,850
So I'm, yeah.

1470
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,549
I'm really thankful you, I'm
thankful you wrote that book.

1471
00:59:20,555 --> 00:59:23,460
I'm thankful you, uh, you
talked to me in the airport.

1472
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,930
It's been really great for me.

1473
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,279
James Clear: Oh, that's awesome.

1474
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:27,600
Thank you so much for sharing that.

1475
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,540
And, uh, ultimately that's what
the whole thing is for, right?

1476
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,509
I mean, it just, it makes it feel
like it was worth the effort to

1477
00:59:33,509 --> 00:59:36,180
spend a few years writing it and
working on it, so, that's great.

1478
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:36,600
Justin Jackson: Yeah.

1479
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,319
Um, so before you go, um, some
people are asking like, what

1480
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,129
recommendations for systems,
services, tools, trackers?

1481
00:59:44,129 --> 00:59:45,839
I know you have a
new one coming out.

1482
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:46,680
Do you wanna talk about that?

1483
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:47,670
James Clear: Uh, sure.

1484
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:47,940
Yeah.

1485
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,590
So I got it right here
next to me actually.

1486
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:53,220
So this is a habit journal, um,
and we, uh, we just launched it,

1487
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,290
um, two weeks ago and it's got,
it's basically a doc grid notebook.

1488
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,330
So if you're into bullet
journaling or you're into keeping

1489
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,300
a notebook or use a notebook,
uh, the vast majority of it are

1490
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,330
doc grid pages, so you'll be able
to use it like any normal one.

1491
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,450
But then at the back there's
a section with a habit tracker

1492
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:12,720
templates, and I don't know if
you can see that very well, but

1493
01:00:12,725 --> 01:00:15,150
I've been using it, for example,
this is this month, so you can

1494
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:16,830
see me tracking my habits on here.

1495
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:21,569
Um, and, uh, so anyway, those,
uh, templates are in the back

1496
01:00:21,569 --> 01:00:23,759
and they're also perforated,
so you can tear 'em out and

1497
01:00:23,759 --> 01:00:26,040
put 'em on your desk or put
'em on your kitchen counter or

1498
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,390
your refrigerator or whatever.

1499
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,900
Yeah.

1500
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:31,290
And then, uh, and then at the very
beginning of the book, there is a

1501
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,210
section called One Line Per Day.

1502
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,620
So I've been using it
for what happened today.

1503
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:39,140
And so I've been writing
down what happened each day.

1504
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,190
And uh, there are 31 lines, so
one for each day of the month,

1505
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,810
and, uh, there are 12 of 'em.

1506
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:47,300
So by the time you get to the
end of the year, you should be

1507
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,330
able to flip through and see,
you know, if you, I'm doing

1508
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,040
what happened today, Sean Blanc.

1509
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,440
It does, uh, what's the
highlight of the day.

1510
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:54,830
Yeah.

1511
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,840
Um, some other ones that
I've seen are, you know,

1512
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,100
what am I grateful for?

1513
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,200
Or you could use it as
like a productivity thing.

1514
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,360
You could say like, what's
my most important task today?

1515
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:02,420
Yeah.

1516
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,500
Uh, things like that.

1517
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,380
So there are a lot of examples
in the back of the Notebook

1518
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:09,230
who I have like 16 pages of
examples of how to use it.

1519
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:12,590
But, uh, but anyway, it's uh,
called The Habit Journal and,

1520
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,210
um, yeah, I'm excited about it.

1521
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,910
I think it'll be a, a good tool to
help people build better habits.

1522
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,420
Cool.

1523
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,400
Justin Jackson: And a lot of folks,
I've heard from a lot of folks

1524
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,160
that really like the audiobook,
so a few folks aren't readers,

1525
01:01:22,165 --> 01:01:23,450
go check out the audiobook.

1526
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,330
Uh, people like us
read Atomic Habits.

1527
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,410
Is that, does that works?

1528
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:28,990
I love it.

1529
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,980
So thanks again for
your time James.

1530
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:31,940

1531
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:32,820

Justin Jackson: There you go.
