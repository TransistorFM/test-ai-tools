1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,960
 I'm Noah and I'm Ben and you're listening to Product Journey.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,360
 Hey folks, today we got Justin Jackson on the podcast.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,600
 He is the co-founder of Transistor, which is a podcasting hosting company.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,800
 He's also the founder of Megamaker, a community for founders and of course, avid podcast lover

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,480
 and listener. Hi Justin. Hey, how's it going? It's nice to be here. Thanks for coming on,

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,640
 Justin. I listen to the show every week, so it's fun to finally talk to people that you only

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,800
 hear talking to you. Yes, same actually. Stuck to have you. Yeah, we can kind of finally make this

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,120
 one by one connection. Now we can just like talk actually together instead of, oh you listen,

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:05,760
 then I'll listen. Yeah, totally. It's funny also because I've seen Ben before. We've never talked,

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,800
 but I had to come up with a vision in my head of what Noah looked like and now I can actually see.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,720
 For the rest of the listeners at home, they don't know yet, but now I know. I'm a part of the secret

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:28,720
 club. Yeah, was it what you expected? Well, usually I've been podcasting since 2012 and

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,480
 usually I'm the disappointment when people meet me in person. They go, I thought you would be a

14
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,920
 lot taller. Yeah, I feel like that always happens when you hear someone's voice. Like you,

15
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,360
 you know, if it's deeper, you kind of, you know, depict a certain kind of person in your mind or

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,120
 just depend on the voice and then usually it's always not what you're thinking. Yeah, yeah. See,

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:01,600
 if I had to guess, I'd guess that Noah is about six feet tall and I'm going to guess Ben is about

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:09,840
 the same height as me. I'm five foot eight. How did I do? So you're pretty good. I'm six foot three.

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,200
 Okay. And I'm trying to calculate centimeters to foot right now. Oh yeah. See, this is the weird

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,000
 Canadian thing is that we use the metric system, but we are so close to the US that we end up doing

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,480
 measurements in inches. So I'm almost exactly six foot tall. Oh, you're almost exactly six feet. Okay.

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,160
 See now, now everybody knows everybody's just adjusted. Maybe we should just, maybe we should

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,600
 just attach images to the show notes. So photos of us. I think, I think every podcast show notes

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:52,000
 needs to have stats on people. Noah, six foot three. Ben. Yeah. 60, how many centimeters is that?

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,240
 That's one, 185 or 186. 185 centimeters. Yeah. Give people some stats, you know.

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,360
 That's what they want to hear. Blue eyes, dark, bondage, dirty blonde hair.

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:16,080
 Form a picture. So, yeah. So we're glad to have you on the show, Justin. We kind of, two topics

28
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,720
 that we're kind of interested in that I know you talk a decent amount about is like audience building

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,720
 and like your market and starting with a market instead of an idea. So we kind of wanted to jump

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:37,600
 into both those two topics and just kind of dig deeper into that. Perfect. So yeah. It's like my

31
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,640
 favorite thing to talk about right now. Yeah. I think some people are getting sick of me talking

32
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,560
 about it, but I just can't stop thinking about it. So it's what naturally kind of comes out.

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,200
 And actually I had, we had a question about that kind of like with building an audience. That was

34
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,760
 one of the things we're interested in. Like, do you ever feel like you run out of new things to say?

35
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,160
 I mean, one thing that's been helpful for me is that since 2013, we've had this online community

36
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:19,360
 with Mega Maker. And so people are interacting and asking questions all the time. And those discussions

37
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:29,120
 often inspire my thinking of, oh, wait a second. It's actually, like a lot of my tweets come out

38
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,200
 of conversations that I've had inside of Mega Maker or things I'm listening to on a podcast

39
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,320
 or even things I've read in a book. I'm reading something and it brings up these thoughts. And

40
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:53,120
 I treat Twitter kind of like the local comedy club, where you go and test out material.

41
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:01,760
 It's like, okay, I'm going to try this out and see how it lands. And it's also just a helpful way for

42
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:09,280
 me to process my thinking. So no, I haven't run out of things to talk about yet. I do have moments

43
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,360
 like John and I are doing our podcast now. And I think we're ready for the year to be done in some

44
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,280
 ways, ready for things to kind of wind down. And so I think there's such thing as fatigue

45
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,520
 when you're publishing something every week and you eventually need to give your brain space to

46
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:40,320
 just explore other things and have other ideas. But yeah, most of the time, as long as I'm

47
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,320
 interacting with people and real life situations and also doing experiments in my own life,

48
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,440
 I haven't run out of anything to say yet. Yeah, I could see the fatigue in that you feel like

49
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,480
 you have to have something to say, at least every week when you have the podcast. You have to have

50
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:05,280
 a new thing that you're thinking about or that you can dive into. Yeah, we've definitely kind

51
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,400
 of seen that. Yeah, and I think this is what that's why breaks are important. I almost get this more

52
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,040
 with because podcasting, you can just turn on the mics and if you have a rough idea of where you

53
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:25,760
 want to go, you can talk it out. But writing, I find, is a lot more takes a lot more of my energy.

54
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,440
 And so writing that weekly newsletter that I write is, there are definitely weeks where that is tough.

55
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,600
 Not because I don't have an idea, but sometimes to process ideas and actually

56
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,880
 write it in a way that makes sense is hard. But yeah, in either case, breaks are good.

57
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,960
 I can only say I'm receiving that newsletter and you're doing pretty good, I guess.

58
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,920
 Yes, I'm enjoying it.

59
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,520
 That almost gives me more pressure because then I'm like, oh, people like it. I got to keep going.

60
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,120
 Yeah, well in that case, I hated it.

61
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,840
 So we got a couple of questions about audience and I think I have a pretty interesting one.

62
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,160
 That is, what makes a good audience and do you think that you should like,

63
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,240
 do you think you have to be part of your audience? Do you have to feel comfortable among the people?

64
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:37,040
 So I've actually changed my tune a little bit on this. I think now if you're starting a business,

65
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,160
 the market is the most important thing, the market you choose. And when I say market,

66
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:52,080
 I don't mean market as in just a identifiable group of people. I'm talking about a group of people

67
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:03,120
 that buys X. So the diamond market last year was $4.5 billion or something like that. To me,

68
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:13,600
 that's a market. It's a market where you can see people in motion, preferably buying something,

69
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,960
 but sometimes it's just people in motion doing something. And everything kind of hinges on that,

70
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:29,520
 which market you are in. So as an example, Taylor Otwell is the founder of Laravel,

71
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,400
 which is the most popular PHP programming framework in the world. He has a huge audience.

72
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,160
 If you look at his audience, quote unquote, on Twitter, he's got, I don't know, hundreds of

73
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:51,680
 thousands of followers. Let's just check because I don't want people to be. So well, he has,

74
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,280
 okay, he has 82,000 followers on Twitter. So for a lot of people, that would be a big audience.

75
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,960
 Mm hmm. And if you go to LaraCon, you see he's got 800 people in the audience, right?

76
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,760
 And he has tons of people buying his stuff. He has millions of people using Laravel.

77
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,440
 But all of that is in the context of a bigger market. It's hard to count the number of

78
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,080
 programmers in the world, but let's just say a reasonable estimate is that there's 5 million

79
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,400
 PHP programmers in the world. Would you agree with that, Ben?

80
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,320
 Yeah, definitely. I've actually used Laravel for a couple of projects.

81
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:46,240
 Okay, there you go. And so 5 million PHP programmers in the world. And let's just take

82
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,280
 one element of that market, not including all the tools they buy, not including everything else that

83
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,840
 you need to be a programmer. Let's just think about salary. And these are just guesses, but

84
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:08,240
 let's say on average, an average PHP programmer in the world makes $25,000 a year. Well, 25,000

85
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:20,880
 times 5 million is 125 billion, I think. That's $125 billion being spent on salaries for PHP

86
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,560
 developers alone. That's a massive market. It's not just a big group of people, but it's also a

87
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,800
 big group of people where there's some sort of economic activity being generated. And

88
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,440
 I think it's why products in the Laravel community often have a magnified

89
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,840
 impact compared to other things. So I have a course called Marketing for Developers that did

90
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,600
 pretty good. But if you take all of the developers in the world and then you ask how many of those

91
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,880
 developers want to learn marketing, it's a much smaller slice. How many developers in the world

92
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,280
 are PHP developers that want to make their jobs better? Well, that's probably 5 million.

93
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:20,640
 Mm-hmm. And so you can compare results and you can see that kind of everything hinges on the market.

94
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,320
 How big the market is, how big your audience can be within that market. And then all the multiples

95
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,600
 all kind of depend on that. So how much money is being spent in that market already and how much

96
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:43,360
 of that can you carve off for yourself? You know, Taylor, presumably, he's only carved off a little

97
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,120
 bit of the PHP market. Like there's still other frameworks. There's still programmers that don't

98
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,560
 know or use about, sorry, don't know about or use Laravel. So he's still got plenty of room to grow

99
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,960
 as well. But even then, like Taylor Ottwell as a solo person has sold $10 million worth of software

100
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:14,160
 to PHP developers. That's pretty crazy. That's insane. And he just recently took on employees.

101
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,040
 So, you know, there's funded startups in San Francisco right now that have millions of dollars

102
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,880
 in funding. Staff of 50 people and they haven't sold $10 million worth of software.

103
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,840
 I think the market that you're in determines everything. And when you have

104
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,520
 what Corey Gwynn calls demonstrated demand, so you can actually see the demand,

105
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,640
 that's kind of what you're looking for. You're looking for people in motion.

106
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,040
 A large group of people in motion who are where there's economic activity being generated from

107
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,880
 whatever they're doing. So yeah, so you would basically say start out with the market, try to

108
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,680
 find a market you want to work in and then start building an audience around that. Like don't worry

109
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,760
 as much about do you feel comfortable in that audience or yeah, those kind of things. I mean,

110
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,400
 I mean, this is where it gets tricky. This is why business is so hard because you have to,

111
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:29,280
 you apply all of these filters to get to where you want to go. So it's like, it's not enough

112
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,000
 to just be in a good market. You actually have to be interested in that market.

113
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:44,880
 You have to have good founder market fit. You have to, you know, you have to then be able to

114
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:54,240
 identify some sort of need in that market. You have to, then you have to actually

115
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,160
 execute on some things and, you know, make some sort of connection. I don't think you have to

116
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:10,320
 necessarily build an audience, but you get a lot of leverage from who you know and who knows you.

117
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,160
 Who you know is just making connections. We're making connections right now. Now the three of

118
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,560
 us know each other and even the fact that we've been on a phone call makes it a lot easier for me

119
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,640
 to ask a favor of you in the future or for you to ask a favor of me. That's networking. That's who

120
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:38,800
 you know. Who knows you is the audience effect and that, I mean, that could be very helpful.

121
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,960
 There are people who have built businesses without doing that. Ruben Gámez is a good example

122
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,160
 of someone who's just built a software business almost purely on search engine results and

123
00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:01,200
 optimizing search engine results. I think it's one of the levers you can use. I think without

124
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,800
 any sort of human connection, it's very difficult. You do have to connect with other people.

125
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,200
 You do have to connect with other human beings and again this is why it's helpful to be interested

126
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:26,000
 in the market you're in. Sometimes even that can be enough. I'm really interested in the Laravel

127
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 community. I'm not really a Laravel developer, but I've spoken at their conference three times.

128
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:42,320
 I really like the people and I would say I'm part of the community even though I'm not a power user

129
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:52,720
 of Laravel. There has to be something that draws you to that market. There has to be something that

130
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,360
 keeps you there and you're probably going to need some sort of connection with some key people in

131
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:09,680
 that market to make it work. How you get there is kind of the individual journey. I'm almost 40 now

132
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:20,800
 and it's very difficult to say what are the 10 steps that brought you to Transistor because

133
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:30,000
 it's layer on layer on layer of my life going back to when I was a kid. All of those steps

134
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,040
 up till now lead me to where I'm at now. I think you can optimize for some of those things. Where

135
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:46,560
 you point yourself in life has a big determination of where you'll end up. I think the connections

136
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:57,200
 you make matter a lot. I think what you put out into the world matters a lot. Podcasting, blogging,

137
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:06,240
 public speaking, but even just anything not open source projects. Anything you put out into the

138
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:15,040
 world can help. In terms of adding all those up and going, okay, what really matters? A lot harder

139
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,800
 to figure that out. I think that's a pretty interesting point because when we started out

140
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,480
 with a podcast, I think we were both on the track of we should build an audience.

141
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:33,200
 It's kind of like we're shifting away from that a little bit. I recently came across this tweet from

142
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,160
 Jane Portman and Rob Walling, Jane Portman from Usalist, who were also talking about that, how

143
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,320
 they didn't really need an audience. It just fits very well to what you just said, I guess.

144
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,680
 There's one more thing that I would like to get your opinion on because you're probably

145
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,760
 familiar with Derek Reimer and what happened with Level. Do you feel like having an audience

146
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,480
 might not always be not necessary, but also maybe lead to false positives?

147
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,840
 Oh, definitely. Yeah. Again, it can be really helpful too. To say that

148
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,840
 my audience didn't help in launching Transistor would be disingenuous. It definitely helps. It

149
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:31,840
 still helps. But there is a risk because what you're looking for is you're looking for some

150
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:40,240
 sort of momentum. When you launch something, you're trying to gauge what kind of response

151
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,080
 is this getting. When Apple releases the new iPhone, how many people are lined up outside

152
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:57,120
 of the Apple store? Apple actually can fall prey to this because they've got all these

153
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,840
 mega fans that are going to line up day one no matter what. You could see these huge lineups

154
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,520
 and you could go, oh wow, the new iPhone is a big success. But unless the rest of the world

155
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,640
 shows up, then it's not going to be a success. Yeah, that's a pretty good analogy.

156
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,400
 Lineups on day one, they are helpful, but they can also,

157
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,080
 like I've launched things, I think still to this day my best launch ever

158
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:41,680
 was for this online series on product marketing. The first couple weeks, tons of people showed up.

159
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,360
 When I started asking them, what are you hoping to achieve out of this? What brought you here?

160
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,840
 They said, oh, I'm just a big fan. I just get everything that you put out. That's nice, but

161
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:05,920
 it became really clear in the coming months that no one else cared. That's the disadvantage of

162
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,680
 having an audience. When people are really invested in your journey, they're going to show up no

163
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,960
 matter what. They're going to show up just because they have a personal connection to you.

164
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,240
 But ultimately, if you're going to run a business, you need people who are going to show up,

165
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,520
 and then more people are going to show up, and then more people are going to show up.

166
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,280
 This is actually why I think the market you choose matters so much. I've gotten into

167
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,760
 some public disagreements with people who could be right. These are my friends and people I respect.

168
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:48,720
 The idea of going after a small niche, I think—again, maybe people are—I don't know.

169
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,360
 The idea of going after a small niche is just you're limiting yourself to, let's say, a pool of

170
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,720
 5,000, 10,000 people. That's like going to a little tiny stream and trying to scoop up a little bit

171
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:13,200
 of water from a tiny stream, as opposed to going after a big, massive market in motion. That's

172
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,920
 going to a rushing river and just putting your cup in the river and just scooping out. Sure,

173
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,240
 you might be able to fill up your cup at a small little stream, but the rushing river has so much

174
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,280
 water that it's a lot easier for a solo bootstrapper to just put their cup in the

175
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,400
 river and then scoop up a bunch of water. I think sometimes this idea of niche

176
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,000
 leads people to the wrong places. They're just looking for these tiny streams that no one else

177
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,440
 has ever discovered before. They say, well, we've got to avoid the big rivers because everyone knows

178
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,640
 about those. Yeah, but it's a lot easier to get your cup in a big river and scoop out some water

179
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,360
 than to find this tiny little thing that nobody knows exists. Yeah, and in the end, your cup is

180
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:12,720
 bigger than the river. Exactly. I wonder if where the kind of disagreement that you have with people

181
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 about that idea really just comes from the end goal with what people want to do with their business.

182
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,680
 Basically, where I hear what you're saying, I guess the opposite of what you say in that find a

183
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:36,240
 niche market, the advice that I have typically seen that from is places like Y Combinator or

184
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,440
 startups that are really trying to do a go big or go home kind of business. I think a good example

185
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,400
 is Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, his book Zero to One. I don't know if you've heard of that or

186
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,360
 read it, but that's almost his whole thing is basically go for the new markets. That's where

187
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,280
 you can make, really, there's a lot of opportunity to make a huge business and that's kind of like

188
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,000
 what PayPal, Facebook, some of those giant companies now did. Well, so yeah, if people

189
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,440
 that are saying that kind of advice are venture capitalists or people that that's their goal,

190
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 then I could see that making sense. But for bootstrappers, I think that is then very dangerous.

191
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,800
 So maybe, I don't know, I'm just wondering maybe that's where the disconnect is

192
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,200
 between those different ideas. Yeah, I think part of it is probably semantics

193
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,680
 and part of it is this is all really emotional stuff because the way that you are currently doing

194
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:46,320
 your thing kind of informs your bias. The way that you've achieved success in the past informs

195
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:53,040
 your bias. I mean, I said things at 20 years old that I don't believe anymore. I said things at 30

196
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,520
 years old that I don't believe anymore. And so a lot of this is just where we're at and what's

197
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:08,400
 working for us right now. And I mean, I was on Twitter, this guy, Evan Golden was saying,

198
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,240
 you can stretch the definition pretty wide. It's always easy to justify,

199
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:26,240
 people are spending money. What did he say? He said, people are spending money on tacos everywhere.

200
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,800
 This could justify me in opening a taco stand featuring dirt flavored tacos.

201
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,040
 There's lots of evidence people want tacos. Evan's a friend of mine, but these are the kind of

202
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:45,920
 arguments I get into on Twitter. But I think that unfortunately, that's exactly what I do want to do

203
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:55,680
 is I want to say, is there any evidence in this market of prior of demonstrated demand? That's

204
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,320
 just a great word from Corey Gwynn. And so PayPal, let's take PayPal as an example.

205
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,480
 What was the market for what PayPal was doing before PayPal existed? What was massive?

206
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:19,200
 The Western Union, like bank transfer, like money transfer market, people trying to pay for things

207
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,560
 with credit cards online, but having to go through their credit card processors. There's all sorts of

208
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,880
 friction, but there's tons of evidence that there was billions of dollars being spent in that

209
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,520
 market already. And so it's not like PayPal invented anything. I mean, sure, they created

210
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,640
 a new way of doing those things, but they didn't create the market. They were riding a wave that

211
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,040
 already existed. They just saw the wave coming and they built a better surfboard that enabled them

212
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:55,680
 to ride further than anyone else had at the time. And this is what I'm talking about is really,

213
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,440
 in some ways, what Evan is saying is like, I'm stretching the definition to say,

214
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:11,040
 is there any sort of prior or existing demonstrated demand for this thing?

215
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,840
 And I think you could see that in almost every major product launch.

216
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,440
 Like the iPhone, before the iPhone was the Blackberry and the Palm, and you can keep going

217
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,920
 back and back and back, right? There's a demonstrated demand for these things. Even if you look at,

218
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:39,680
 I can remember as a kid looking in catalogs wanting to buy a portable television,

219
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,560
 right? From Radio Shack or whatever. There was demand for portable televisions that were battery

220
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:55,280
 operated. They never worked very well, but there was demonstrated demand for that thing. Well,

221
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,080
 a big part of the iPhone is just a portable television. And I think that's the reason why

222
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,560
 just a portable television, right? At least that's how my kids use it. It's like Netflix all day long.

223
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:15,120
 Yeah, definitely now. So I think the point is to look for some sort of demonstrated demand

224
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,640
 and to think, is this a market in motion? Is there evidence that people are doing something

225
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:31,920
 about this right now? So, yeah. Yeah, so the market is kind of being defined as

226
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,880
 like a problem to be solved or like a job to be done rather than, I don't know, maybe how like

227
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,080
 marketers sometimes think about markets as almost, I feel like they can kind of put it into a box of

228
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:52,240
 like a specific solution or a specific area in that way. So yeah, really focusing from what you're

229
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,120
 saying, it sounds like, yeah, really focusing on the problem that needs to be solved. Is that a big

230
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:08,160
 market of people want that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Exactly. That's exactly what I'm talking about.

231
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,360
 There's lots. You can see this with, if you go into product hunt and you find,

232
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,680
 I run into this all the time, products that are no longer around. There's all these like dead startups.

233
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:34,640
 Oh yeah. And in almost every case, there just wasn't enough demonstrated demand for that thing.

234
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,880
 They were good ideas. They kind of made sense logically. But if you looked at it and go,

235
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,080
 okay, but who's doing something about this right now? That's really what's most interesting about

236
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,480
 Derek Reimer's story is that once he started talking to the people on his waiting list and

237
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,280
 asking, okay, well, what are you doing about this problem right now? And often their response was,

238
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,320
 well, nothing. We haven't done anything. You haven't searched on Google for an answer? No.

239
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:15,760
 You haven't searched the Slack extension store? No. Well, that's a bad sign. If people aren't even

240
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,520
 willing to do something free, which is just search for a solution, how are you going to

241
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,600
 convince them to jump over all of these hurdles and actually take out their credit card out of

242
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:33,840
 their wallet and pay you for something? And this is another thing I've maybe had a hard time to

243
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:42,640
 articulate is it takes so much momentum to get someone to take out their credit card

244
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,240
 that you've got to be sure that what you're proposing is something that they really,

245
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,480
 really want. And really the only way to figure that out, the only way to see that clearly is,

246
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,960
 are they doing something about it right now? And is there enough of these people on mass doing this,

247
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,320
 doing something about it right now? Yeah, I love that piece of advice. I actually thought that it's,

248
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,840
 I think it was actually you who said that you should go to Twitter and just search,

249
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,360
 search if people are typing something like, I don't know, maybe even using their grammar example,

250
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,240
 search in Twitter for switching away from Slack or switch away from Slack and see how many results

251
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,600
 you actually find. And there are a couple I did that for fun. But yeah. And I mean, that's just

252
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,920
 step one, right? Because it's pretty low friction to tweet your disappointment with something. But

253
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:45,120
 at least that's something. And then you would actually want to talk with folks and ask them

254
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:52,000
 questions like, okay, well, what caused you to switch? How long did you think about switching

255
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,880
 before it happened? What did you have to do internally in your team to make that switch happen?

256
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,000
 And that's where you're going to get a lot of answers. It's one reason I worked for a

257
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,320
 project management software startup. And what I didn't know before I joined is how hard it is

258
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,640
 to get people to switch project management software. And it's remarkably difficult because

259
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,440
 everybody has an opinion on the team, right? The developers want one thing,

260
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,200
 the marketing folks want one another thing, the CTO wants one thing, like it goes around and around.

261
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:34,880
 And so you have to convince not just one person, but 10, 20 people to make this decision.

262
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,880
 And then the other kind of bad sign. So despite how difficult it is to get people to switch,

263
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,480
 people do switch all the time. And that's also a bad sign because they don't just switch once,

264
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,120
 and then they're satisfied. They switch, they try Trello, and then they're like, no, this didn't work.

265
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,840
 And then they try Basecamp, and then like, oh, that doesn't work. And then they try Jira.

266
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:07,760
 They all end up in Jira, right? That's how it works. And so when you actually get into those

267
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,560
 real discussions with people about what does the actual process look like, even a market like

268
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:28,160
 project management, it has its own minefield, right? Like there's pros and cons. And I think

269
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,520
 for bootstrappers, it's a lot harder. It's why we've seen, you know, Basecamp got in early,

270
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,000
 and so they've done okay. But really, besides Basecamp, everybody else is venture funded

271
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,800
 because it just costs so much money. And if you get on their list, like people, Jira will call you.

272
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:51,120
 They've got salespeople that want to onboard you, right? Because they know the only way to push this

273
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:58,640
 through the whole funnel is to have a lot of kind of concerted effort doing it. So a lot of these

274
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:05,920
 things, a lot of these decisions depend on whether or not you're bootstrapping, whether or not you're

275
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,640
 bootstrapping as a solo founder, because some of these ideas and markets are just harder to reach

276
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:22,480
 as a bootstrapper or solo founder. Right. So with that in mind, and you know, starting with the

277
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,920
 market, I guess, and maybe some ways what sounds like what you'd say is basically start with the

278
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:34,800
 market filter. Like that's the first filter that you want to put on of how to basically choose

279
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,160
 what problem you're going to solve, how you're going to do it. How do you,

280
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,160
 like it seems like, you know, you start talking to customers, start talking to users,

281
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,520
 it takes a while before you can really know what's the right approach, what's the right solution to

282
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,960
 actually build. What do you do if that solution ends up being something that isn't something that

283
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,480
 a bootstrapper can do? Or maybe it's a solution that doesn't use your strengths, you know, as a

284
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,600
 founder, it doesn't use your skills, your abilities. So how do you handle that when, I guess,

285
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:19,360
 starting with a market? Because, yeah, I mean, I guess in some ways it kind of goes back to there's

286
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,920
 just all these filters and in some ways all these things have to align, which is obviously very hard.

287
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:33,360
 Yeah, I mean, I think that's just the, this is another unpopular tweet of mine, but it is just,

288
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:40,800
 and I had to admit this before I had any success, but what you kind of have to admit in some way,

289
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,720
 on one side is we're not all going to make it. And a lot of people don't like hearing that,

290
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:56,240
 but we're not all going to make it. There's no way that every single aspiring entrepreneur in the

291
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:03,200
 world can apply all of these filters and come out on the other side. And by the way, even you come

292
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,560
 out on the other side and, you know, like I have a business now that's doing pretty well,

293
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:16,400
 it could disappear tomorrow. Every day I wake up going, well, maybe today's the day it disappears,

294
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:25,360
 right? Because markets change and they can change really fast. And so there's no,

295
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,400
 like there's nothing really romantic about starting a business. It's just,

296
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:39,920
 there's all sorts of things that have to align for it to work. And a lot of us aren't going to make it.

297
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,160
 So you have to hold that on one side. Well, at the same time on the other side, these things are

298
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,680
 intention. On the other side, you have to be super optimistic that you're going to make it

299
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,280
 and that you're just going to keep trying because the other thing I've seen anecdotally, I don't

300
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,440
 know if this is scientific, but the people who keep trying, who keep working at it, who keep pushing

301
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:13,280
 that ball forward, many of them do make it. And so there's a little bit of how long can you last,

302
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,240
 how long can you try? It's why a lot of successful entrepreneurs actually tend to be statistically

303
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,880
 older because by that point in your life, you've had a bunch of industry experience. So you know

304
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,160
 what an industry is, you know, you've got connections in that industry, you've seen the

305
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,240
 pain points, you've seen how they spend money, you know, there's all of this accrued experience

306
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:49,360
 that ends up being helpful. And, you know, time is kind of what allows you to keep pushing, right?

307
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,840
 So it's not saying you shouldn't try in your 20s, but because you could, it could all align, right?

308
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,840
 My friend Nathan Barry is not even 30 yet and has already achieved more as a founder than a lot of

309
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:09,760
 folks. But I think you have to have this idea of, well, it might not happen, but I'm going to try,

310
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:17,280
 and this might be a 10-year project or this might be a 20-year project. And you almost have to be

311
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,600
 okay with that. Like, this just might take time for everything to align. And the whole time I'm

312
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:30,560
 going to have to be working as if this will eventually work out. And not just doing the

313
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,080
 same thing, putting yourself in new circles, getting outside of your comfort zone. I've

314
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:43,040
 described this before as, is it Command and Conquer that uses Fog of War where you're just on a map

315
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,960
 and everything's dark and you're exploring it? So if you think about that as a metaphor, like,

316
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,000
 when you start out, you're just in that map and all you can see is around you, right? And as you

317
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,080
 explore more of the map, more and more parts become illuminated. And every once in a while,

318
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,440
 you'll end up in a spot of the map where things just happen, right? Like, you get a bunch of

319
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,400
 bounty or you run into a bunch of enemies or whatever. And it's kind of like that. Like,

320
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,960
 you're walking around. For me, for example, I was walking around and I just happened to

321
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:28,560
 run into Adam Wathen, who I had no idea who he was or anything about him. But he ended up being

322
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,880
 quite an influential person in the Laravel community. And that was just me wandering

323
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,920
 around the map and him wandering around the map too. And then I was meeting each other. And once

324
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:50,160
 I could see, like, I've learned tons about a lot of my thoughts about, like, choosing a market first

325
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:59,040
 have been because of the influence of the Laravel community and looking at Taylor and Adam Wathen

326
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,920
 and Steve Shoger and Jeffrey Way build these crazy businesses. Because in my little world,

327
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,920
 before I met them, you know, this is the way things were done. People like us do things like this.

328
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,000
 And then I got over into that area of the map and it was like this whole new world opened up

329
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,960
 that I'd never seen before. And without that world opening up, I don't think I would have.

330
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,960
 Well, I don't think a lot of things would have happened. And so there's

331
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,680
 clearly you have to kind of be always doing things, trying things, getting out of your comfort zone,

332
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,520
 meeting new people. And I think the advice I would give my kids is just to explore as much

333
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:53,280
 of the map as you can, as early as you can. Because the more exploration you do, I think I

334
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,480
 stayed too local too long. You know, I grew up in a small little farming town in Alberta.

335
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,120
 And then the big city was Edmonton. And I just spent too much time there. And then, you know,

336
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:12,000
 like the first time I flew into New York, I was like, holy shit, like, there's a lot of people

337
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,160
 here. There's a lot of money here. There's a lot of businesses here that I've never even

338
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,760
 imagined before. And it kind of expanded my whole worldview. And unless you're doing that work to

339
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,880
 kind of walk around the map and discover new areas. Yeah, I think it'll be harder to,

340
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,080
 you know, to find those markets, to find those ideas.

341
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,280
 Yeah. So I want to go back a little bit to something you said, you know, kind of talking about how

342
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,080
 basically this might not work for all of us. And it's very hard. And yeah, we all might not

343
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:58,000
 make it through. And that's just kind of the truth of it. So like, how do you and I'm just

344
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,560
 curious about your situation. Like, how do you go to your wife with that and get her on board for

345
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,640
 this whole journey of what we're trying to do? Because that's I'm just curious because that's

346
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,960
 definitely something I know me and my wife struggle with a lot just with my last thing. And like,

347
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,120
 it is hard. So it's like it's, you know, you it's not just you going on this journey. You're

348
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:27,440
 bringing your whole family with you. Yeah. I mean, again, you probably don't want to look

349
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,600
 at the statistics. The statistics are pretty bad. Just don't look. So this podcast has to be titled

350
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,760
 Unpopular Opinions with Jackson Jackson. I mean, it's just like if you want the reality,

351
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:49,120
 the reality is not good statistically. I mean, clearly, I think I think all entrepreneurs have

352
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:55,520
 this feeling that maybe they can do it better than the next guy. And because statistically,

353
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,920
 you know, millions of people start businesses, but those people are in all sorts of different places,

354
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,440
 have all sorts of different leverage, have all sorts of different privilege. You know, there's

355
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,920
 there's all these factors that go into, you know, why a person becomes a success or not.

356
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,720
 And I think every entrepreneur feels like they've got some secret sauce that'll make them better

357
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:28,880
 than the next guy. Oh, yeah. But I mean, in my early 20s, I started a couple retail shops

358
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,520
 that ended up losing a lot of money, and that was hard to recover from as a family.

359
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,280
 And so that that is just part of it. Like if you're going to be on that. So that was

360
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:52,480
 almost 20 years ago. And yeah, so now I'm at a place where, you know, maybe I've learned enough

361
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,840
 lessons and I've made enough connections that things are happening. But that's a long journey.

362
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:09,360
 That's 10, 20 years of of work. And so. Yeah, I mean, I think that's something you got to consider

363
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,760
 with kind of with everything. I don't think you should kill yourself in the process. I think

364
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,280
 I think I worked probably too hard a lot of those years when I didn't need to. It's just

365
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,600
 wasted cycles trying to make something happen. You know, you're it's far better for you to

366
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:33,440
 book a ticket to a conference that you've never been to than to work 60, 70, 80 hours a week.

367
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:42,240
 Because at least for me, the biggest jumps forward have been because I met somebody outside of my

368
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:52,480
 circle. I met John Buddha, my co-founder, in 2014 at this kind of experimental technology art

369
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,680
 design festival called XOXO. And, you know, I wasn't going to go initially. I had to kind

370
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:07,440
 of push myself to get out of the house and actually go. So yeah, I don't think there's any easy answers

371
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:15,600
 there. I think you can stair step your way up. You can do something small on the side and then

372
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,760
 see if that evolves into something bigger and then something bigger and then something bigger.

373
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:27,920
 Nathan Barry just wrote a piece on this that I don't fully like or agree with, but maybe I

374
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:35,520
 don't like it just because it's the hard truth. He talks about a series of ladders and, you know,

375
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,960
 the first ladder is just like trading time for money and then you kind of work up that ladder,

376
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,560
 right? You can work yourself up from making minimum wage up to making more money per hour.

377
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,880
 But then you go to the next ladder, which has higher earning potential, but it's harder. It's

378
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,240
 just like, okay, now you've got to you're trading time for money, but it's more on your terms,

379
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:05,760
 like consulting. And so then you work your way up that level. And then there's another ladder.

380
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,840
 And, you know, these keep going and the difficulty with each ladder goes up. And

381
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,000
 but your potential, in his case, he's just talking about income earning potential,

382
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,640
 your income earning potential goes up as well. And it is a little bit of a

383
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,280
 stair step, right? Like you're moving your way up here and then you're like, oh, well,

384
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,080
 there's opportunity over here. So then you might take a few steps back to start here and then

385
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,240
 build yourself up here. And then you look at the next ladder, you go, there's more opportunity

386
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:44,240
 over there. So then you go back down and then work your way up. Yeah, that's all possible.

387
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:54,160
 Definitely helps if you have in terms of like having a decent life. It helps if you have a

388
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,920
 lot more cash saved up. The more cash you have saved up, the less stress you have.

389
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:09,280
 But that's not always possible either. Right. So that the only way I can think of to alleviate

390
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:16,800
 the stress is to have very low cost of living and or a lot of money saved up.

391
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,760
 Yeah.

392
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,200
 Money that you can risk that you wouldn't feel bad about losing.

393
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,520
 So and you can even hear this in John and I's podcast, you know,

394
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,680
 he was working for Cards Against Humanity when we started this. And he also had more money saved

395
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,800
 up than I did. And so my stress level when we weren't quite yet full time yet was a lot higher.

396
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,640
 I'm just like, oh, God, like, do we got to take investment? Do we got to try to add three or four

397
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:58,960
 more things on top of this to make this work? You can see how desperation affects your actions.

398
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,200
 And a lot of businesses you'll see do this. Like one thing's not working quite enough. So then they

399
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,600
 add another thing to hopefully bring up more income. And that's not quite bringing enough.

400
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,120
 So they add another thing and they just keep adding more and more stuff and more and more

401
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:20,640
 stress to their lives. But yeah, for John, it's easy. He's got no dependence and his cost of

402
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:28,880
 living is low. And he had a bunch of money saved up for him. This isn't as this isn't making or

403
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:35,920
 break it. It's like, no, I can just if this doesn't work. Yeah, I'm fine. So that if you want to make

404
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:43,440
 it easier, I think lower your expenses and save a bunch of money or get someone to give you a bunch

405
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:52,000
 of money or rob a bank or whatever. That goes easier out. I mean, this is why privilege plays

406
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,040
 such a big part in business. Like some people do. They get they get a they have a big trust fund and

407
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,520
 they get a bunch of money. It does help. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

408
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,800
 So maybe as a last question we could end with, maybe you've heard the How I Built This podcast.

409
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,680
 They always end with an interesting question, which is so for you, I'm just interested in hearing as

410
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,760
 well, like with Transistor, like where you guys gotten so far, how much do you think of that was

411
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,880
 luck and how much of it was, you know, you and John's skill and talents and hard work?

412
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:38,480
 It's definitely the accumulation of a lifetime of experience. And I think I think your attitude

413
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,960
 matters a lot in that. Right. Like, are you going to keep going out and trying things? Are you going

414
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,240
 to keep going out and trying to push the envelope? Are you going to keep going out and put things out

415
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:57,200
 in public? Are you going to go out and meet people? Like if if if you were going to split

416
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,160
 test my life and you put one Justin in his room and he never leaves and all he does is play Sonic

417
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:11,280
 the Hedgehog forever. And then you have another version where he's like always going out and

418
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,280
 trying to figure things out and trying to build things and trying to write and trying to meet this

419
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:24,880
 person. And for sure, in that A B test, you know, Justin B wins. There's I don't think it's that's

420
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:33,200
 a it's not too difficult to see that. So yeah, there's a lot of luck in where I was born. And

421
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:43,280
 the the the influence of luck starts to go down a lot. Like the the the influence of blind luck,

422
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:50,480
 like just like where you were born, like what what year and country and location and parents

423
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,640
 you were born to. After that part, you make your most of your luck just by whatever attitude you

424
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:05,360
 have every day. There's still some privilege that comes with where you were born, but most of that

425
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,560
 kind of built in luck is already happened by the time you were born.

426
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:17,600
 Yeah. Cool. Well, thanks, Justin, for coming on. That was a good conversation. Very helpful for

427
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,680
 both of us. And I'm sure for our listeners as well. I didn't bum you out too much.

428
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,400
 I mean, sometimes you need a little of that gets you back back to the truth.

429
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,040
 So, yeah, thanks, Justin, and we'll see you guys in another episode.

430
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,040
 And we'll put everything in the show notes. All right. Bye. See you.
