00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,400
 Hey product people, Justin Jackson here and I've got a brand new interview for you with

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,500
 James Clear who is the author of Atomic Habits, a book that has really changed the world.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 It's changed my life since I've read it and I don't want to give too much of an intro,

5
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,100
 I just want to get right into the actual interview. If you like this, please reach out to James

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,700
 on Twitter, at James Clear and if you have comments about the episode, reach out to me

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 on Twitter, I'm the letter M, the letter I, Justin, M-I, Justin. Here is me and James

8
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,300
 talking about habits and how you can make your life better one day at a time.

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,100
 The book, your book's been out for a while, it's right here, Atomic Habits, if you see

10
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,100
 it in an airport or something near you. How long has it been out now?

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
 Today is 100 days exactly.

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 No way!

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,400
 Yeah, so just over three months.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:33,400
 You know, I'm curious because now it's been out for a while, is there one idea that you

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,700
 see that people keep sharing, like one idea that resonated from the book in particular

16
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,900
 that gets shared more than anything else on Twitter or whatever?

17
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,600
 So I was curious about that myself when I was writing the book and thinking about it

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,100
 because I kind of felt like, alright, hopefully all these ideas are useful, what's the one

19
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,840
 thing that people are going to latch onto? Because sometimes you'll hear that from authors

20
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,600
 that there was one chapter or something that was the chapter that really stuck with people.

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 I'm grateful for the fact that there are a variety of things, but there are a few things.

22
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,700
 So the first one is Identity-Based Habits, which is chapter two.

23
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,500
 And that concept really seems to have resonated with people, the idea of trying to reinforce

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,860
 your desired identity and starting with who you want to become rather than what you want

25
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,600
 to achieve.

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,240
 And I'm glad that it did because that was the chapter I debated over the most of where

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,420
 to put it in the book.

28
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,440
 I had it at different points. It was the first chapter, it was the last chapter, it ended

29
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,080
 up being the second one. I also had this thought in my head that it should be about midway

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,240
 through the book. So it really jumped all over the place, but I ended up thinking, I

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,100
 feel like this is one of the best ideas, so I want to have it early so that people, even

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,500
 if they don't finish the book, they still come across this idea. And I'm glad that that

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,980
 ended up working out well.

34
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,300
 The other one that people bring up a lot is the two-minute rule and the idea of scaling

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,960
 your habits down to the point where they take two minutes or less. I think that that's a

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,760
 very actionable one. It's like, okay, I know exactly what to do. I wanted to do a workout,

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,880
 but now I'll just focus on doing five push-ups. Or I wanted to read 30 books this year and

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,040
 now I'll focus on reading one page a day or something like that. So I think the actionableness

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,840
 of that one also tends to stick.

40
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:39,300
 And so going back to the identity one, is this the idea that every action you take or

41
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,500
 every habit you develop is a vote for the person you want to become?

42
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 Right. So that's kind of like my core philosophy behind it. This idea that the way that we

43
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,660
 develop beliefs about ourselves, that we reinforce our self-image, that we develop our identity

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,560
 to a certain degree, is largely reinforced by the experiences and behaviors that we perform

45
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,600
 over time. So some aspects of your identity are relatively fixed. Like, for example, if

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,040
 you're tall or short. But even that idea that I am tall or I am short, that's reinforced.

47
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,880
 You learn that through experiences in life. Now, there are many aspects of your identity

48
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,640
 that are less fixed than that, but are still reinforced by your experiences. So if you

49
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,980
 write one sentence today, you probably don't think about yourself as, I am a writer. But

50
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,820
 if you do that every day for six months or nine months or a year, at some point you turn

51
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,380
 around and you think, huh, maybe I am the kind of person who is a writer. Or if you

52
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,460
 study biology every Tuesday night for 20 minutes, you at some point think, I guess I'm studious.

53
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,980
 I keep doing this every week. Maybe this is the kind of person I am. And so I like that

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,400
 idea that our habits are like votes for the type of person we believe that we are, that

55
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,720
 they build up evidence of looking at ourselves in a certain way. And I like to phrase it

56
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,960
 that way, not only because I believe that it's true, but also like beliefs and behavior

57
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,920
 are kind of a two way street, right? So like you can, you'll hear people say things like,

58
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,280
 well, you know, just be positive or just believe in yourself or fake it till you make it or

59
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,100
 things like that. And there's nothing necessarily wrong with fake it till you make it. Like

60
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,980
 it's fine to be positive and believe things about yourself. But it's a very short term

61
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:39,580
 strategy because fake it till you make it is asking you to believe something about yourself

62
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,940
 without having evidence for it. You know, it's like that kind of visualization stuff

63
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,740
 or mantra stuff where you look at yourself in the mirror and you tell yourself, I am

64
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,620
 a writer, I am a writer, even though you haven't written yet. And so what I'm saying is similar,

65
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,560
 but I think importantly different in the sense that you let the behavior lead the way rather

66
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,800
 than the belief. And I think that's the best lever we have for changing the way that we

67
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,600
 look at ourselves, which is to say, show up and write a sentence every day. And soon you're

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,480
 going to have something to root that new identity of I am a writer in. And it gives, it's a

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,000
 much more, I think, robust and long-term way of changing how you look at yourself.

70
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:25,900
 Yeah, I think for me, the, cause you first communicated that idea to me in an airport

71
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:33,380
 in Denver. Yeah, I remember that. And the, at the time in my life, I was not doing so

72
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:40,100
 good. I was depressed. I was, I think, cynical, especially I think cynical about people like

73
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,780
 you that seem to have it all together, that seem to be really like doing all the good

74
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,800
 habits. And when you're not doing so good, looking at someone that seems to have it all

75
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,640
 together just can make you more grumpy or more cynical or more whatever. But I remember

76
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:08,040
 you sitting down and kind of hashing this out with me and that idea of Justin, no matter

77
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,940
 where you're at right now and no matter what you've done, you could start today with one

78
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:24,940
 action. So if you, you know, go running today, that might not make a big difference. But

79
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,980
 then if you do it tomorrow and then the next day and then the next day and then the next

80
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,980
 day, at the end of the week, you might say, well, wait a second, I think I'm a runner.

81
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,480
 Right? And maybe, you know, after a couple of weeks you might say, well, you know, I'm

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,120
 going to get myself some runner clothes and go and get some runner clothes. And then I'm

83
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,320
 going to get myself a good pair of shoes. I'm going to install that Strava app. And

84
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,840
 all of a sudden you could see yourself. That was very, that was a really hopeful message

85
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,760
 for me when I was really struggling to figure out, it was way easier for me to be cynical

86
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,920
 and just kind of look back at all these people implementing good healthy processes and say,

87
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,340
 well, that's not for me. That's just for people that whatever, you know, but seeing, hearing

88
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:18,060
 that gave me hope to think, you know, I could do that. I could. And it's surprising how

89
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:25,060
 little time it takes to, you know, accomplish that. Is that something, have other people

90
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,820
 been kind of referencing that too? Is that part of the, the, and maybe that's what's

91
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,140
 so good about having it as chapter two, because it gives you some hope, right?

92
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,500
 Well, what's interesting is that that process of changing in that way, it's happening anyway,

93
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,580
 you know, like, I mean, if you think back to like the beginning, like for example, if

94
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,540
 I think of my, the early days of my entrepreneurial career, well, I didn't have any entrepreneurs

95
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,660
 in my family. I didn't have any close friends who were entrepreneurs. There was no reason

96
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,120
 for me to think that's who I am or to feel like I was externally validated with like

97
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,000
 that was part of my identity. I had no evidence of it. And so early on, I just, all I had

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,640
 was hope, right? Like the hope that, oh, maybe I'll be able to build something. Maybe I'll

99
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,720
 be able to make this work. But then you start to show up. And for me, it was probably about

100
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,200
 two years in is probably about where the, where I kind of like the scale tipped. And

101
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,980
 I started to think I am an entrepreneur, like that's part of, of who I am, but it really

102
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,600
 took proving it to myself that I can pay my bills through this, you know, that I can like

103
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,960
 actually have a lifestyle and a career in this way. I had to prove it for about two

104
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:39,720
 years before I really started to latch onto it and say, this is who I am. And so my point

105
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,600
 is that's always happening. You're, you're always can, you're continually updating your

106
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,360
 beliefs about yourself based on the experiences that you're going through. And all I'm talking

107
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,220
 about is simply designing that process and a little more careful or thoughtful way rather

108
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,860
 than just kind of letting it happen to you and be like, well, I guess I'll figure out

109
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,140
 who I am based on what life throws at me versus how about I figure out who I am based on the

110
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,500
 votes that I cast each day and what I decide to, what habits I decide to follow. Yeah.

111
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,800
 Yeah. Again, like that is a very hopeful message for, for someone who's just kind of sitting

112
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,980
 back and waiting for it to happen. What, what sustains you when you're in the, in the process,

113
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,700
 but not there yet. Like, like you mentioned entrepreneur and you're like, man, it took

114
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,780
 a long time. Yeah. What's a really good question because I think a lot of habits, you know,

115
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,660
 entrepreneurship is certainly this way. Exercise is this way where the, the rewards of a habit

116
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,540
 are often very delayed. Uh, you know, like what's the reward for working out for like

117
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,020
 three weeks? Like not really a whole lot, honestly, your body hasn't really changed.

118
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,740
 The scale is probably about the same. Um, you're probably just sore, you know, like

119
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,620
 there, there probably isn't like a whole lot to show for it. Yeah. It's really not unless

120
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,220
 you stick with that habit for three months or six months or a year that you actually

121
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,420
 start to see the changes you were hoping to get when you set out. Yeah. And so there's

122
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,120
 kind of this like valley of death in the beginning where in a way it's sort of like gets harder

123
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,900
 before it gets easier. You know, it feels uncomfortable. You feel sore and pain, uh,

124
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,100
 you feel uncertain when you walk in the gym, you feel like people are judging you. Yeah.

125
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,500
 Same way with starting a business, you know, in a weird way, it's kind of harder before

126
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,380
 it gets easier. You start out, but you're not making any money. You feel stupid a lot

127
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,360
 of the time because you're, you don't know how to make a sales call or what customers

128
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,140
 are looking for or whether you're even offering the right product. Yeah. Um, I remember when

129
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,820
 I first started, I, uh, I, like I said, I didn't know anybody, didn't have any entrepreneurs

130
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,140
 in my family. So I was like, well, I need to get to know some people. Yeah. So I sent

131
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,100
 a bunch of emails to reach out and just ask if people would chat on Skype for like 30

132
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,660
 minutes or whatever. And I remember sending those first few and thinking, is this even,

133
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,100
 do people even do this? Do people chat on Skype with people that they haven't met before?

134
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,860
 Like, is this a weird thing to ask? You know, there's just a lot of that uncertainty early

135
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,940
 on. Yeah. So your point is I think a valid one, which is, well, what do you do to get

136
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,500
 through that? You know, like how do you, how do you kind of get through that valley of

137
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,980
 death while you're waiting for the long-term rewards to accumulate? Yeah. And I think that

138
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,220
 this is where, uh, psychologists call it reinforcement or an external reinforcer, but you, you want

139
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,860
 some kind of reinforcement that is enjoyable in the moment. So you have a reason to keep

140
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,500
 showing up. So there are, there are kind of from a habit standpoint, there are kind of

141
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,220
 two ways to do this. First thing is just a strategic choice about what type of habit

142
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,520
 you choose to follow. So if we go back to the exercise example, well, not everybody

143
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,000
 has to work out like a bodybuilder. You know, you could do Pilates or yoga or go for a run

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,080
 or rock climbing or, you know, all kinds of stuff. And so pick the form of a habit that

145
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,440
 brings you the most joy that is most enjoyable to you. It's going to be a slog for, you know,

146
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
 you're going to have to swim for months to see a change in your body. You're going to

147
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,440
 have to cycle for months. You're going to have to lift weights for months. It doesn't

148
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
 really matter which one you choose. It's going to take a while. So you might as well choose

149
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,560
 the one that's most exciting or enjoyable to you. Same way with like, you know, imagine

150
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,080
 a reading habit, you know, like you don't have to read. You might feel like, oh, I have

151
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,720
 a business so I need to read business books. But really ultimately the most important thing

152
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,920
 is do you get in the habit of reading? Do you fall in love with reading? So if you need

153
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,320
 to start with sci-fi books or fantasy or something like that, well, start with that, you know,

154
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,680
 like do the one that is intrinsically valuable to you at first. And once the habit is built,

155
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,480
 then you can transition to some of the other stuff. Yeah. So that's one method for for

156
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,320
 kind of getting through that valley of death. Yeah. And I think this brings up maybe a harder

157
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:57,760
 question, which is so, you know, based on your book, it's January and I'm thinking,

158
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,540
 okay, you know, I haven't been in the gym for seven years. I used to love working out.

159
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:10,780
 I'm going to go. I got my streaks app on my phone. Start going. And I've probably been,

160
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,500
 I don't know, I've probably been at least 18 days or maybe even 20 days this month.

161
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:23,420
 So it's great. And I was surprised by how fast I felt. So the first day I felt like

162
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,300
 I didn't belong. I felt awkward. I don't know anybody here. I'm walking in. Some of the

163
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,940
 machinery I recognize, some I don't. I have to like, you know, find, get back into a routine.

164
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,380
 I have to find which exercise I'm going to do. There's all these kind of insecurities

165
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:49,020
 and questions. But after a week, I kind of felt like I belonged. But I wonder if that's

166
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:56,740
 because it was easier for me. You know, I had this, you know, I'm I'm relatively I was

167
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,220
 already relatively in shape. So there's a big difference between going in where you feel like,

168
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,460
 oh, maybe I'm a few pounds overweight and going in and being 200 pounds overweight. There's a big

169
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:16,300
 difference between, you know, going in even as a white male compared to, you know, there's a big

170
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,860
 difference going in and feeling like, well, I've done these exercises before, so I'm not completely

171
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:31,900
 out of my element. And I'm wondering how I mean, are our habits like that achievable because of

172
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:38,180
 privilege and context and other things like how much does that play into it? And, you know, if

173
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,540
 someone is walking in and they're 200 pounds overweight, is, you know, do they still have the

174
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,780
 same chance of progress and success? It just feels like such a big mountain for them to go over.

175
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,540
 For sure. Yeah, they're. So this is one reason why I think starting with small habits is so

176
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,700
 incredibly important, because a lot of the time when we think about the outcome that you want. So

177
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,700
 just to continue your weight loss or exercise example. Yeah, everybody gets wrapped up in like,

178
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,660
 oh, I want to lose 100 pounds or I want to lose 20 pounds or whatever the number is. But you

179
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,620
 forget about there like all these little logistical and emotional details that come along with

180
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,540
 starting a new habit. So, you know, I'll often tell the story about I have this reader who he

181
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,980
 ended up losing over 100 pounds. And one of the first things he did was he went to the gym,

182
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,020
 but he wasn't allowed to stay for longer than five minutes. So he drove to the gym, got out of the

183
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,540
 car, did half an exercise, got back in the car, drove home. And it sounds ridiculous to people.

184
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,060
 It sounds silly because it's like, well, clearly exercising for five minutes is not going to get

185
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,260
 you in shape. Like, that's not. But what you realize is he was mastering the art of showing up.

186
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,300
 He was becoming the type of person that drove to the gym every day. And when you're in that state,

187
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,500
 right, for him at that point, that was the biggest shift was can I just become the type of person who

188
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,060
 gets in here, right? Who overcomes the uncertainty or feeling uncomfortable or feeling judged. And

189
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,620
 all those things are very real hurdles to building a habit. You know, like there's there are all these

190
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,860
 little questions that need to be answered for something like that. Like, okay, I want to go to

191
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,900
 the gym. Well, what time am I going to go? Am I going to go before work or after work? What gym

192
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,260
 will I go to? What route am I going to take to get there? Do I need to bring a water bottle or is

193
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,620
 there like a water fountain at the gym? And all those little questions like that, like, you know,

194
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,100
 whether or not you there's a water fountain at the gym, it sounds small. But if you already feel

195
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,060
 uncomfortable and feel like you don't belong, and then you always forget to bring your water bottle

196
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,860
 and you're like, oh, there's nothing ever and there's never anything to drink there. That's

197
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,660
 enough friction to get you to quit in the beginning. So starting with something simple,

198
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,100
 like all I'm going to do is I'm going to show up and I'm going to do one exercise for five minutes

199
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:59,100
 and I'm going to go. That I think is a good way to start. And it reminds me of what Steven Pressfield

200
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,260
 wrote, I think it was in the War of Art, where he said something to the effect of like, if you sit

201
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,020
 down each day at the computer, and you do your writing, at some point, at first, it feels

202
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,300
 uncomfortable. But at some point, that becomes your territory. And I really like that phrasing

203
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,860
 of it, because for an animal for a wolf or something, a plate a piece of land does not

204
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:24,180
 become their territory unless they spend time in it, right? Unless they are there each day,

205
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:30,020
 yeah, it has to become comfortable first. And so for many people building habits, whether that's

206
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,980
 getting into the gym or going to the yoga studio or sitting your butt in the chair and writing,

207
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,980
 you need to make that space your territory. And at the very first step is not getting a result.

208
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,660
 It's spending time there. It's making that little bit of land a zone where you feel like this is

209
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:53,940
 where I belong each day. And that's a big emotional hurdle to cross before you even worry about any

210
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,340
 of the physical or like actual technical things to do. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, the other thing

211
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:06,660
 that helped is I went with my wife. And it's funny because I felt like, you know, I'm like,

212
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:13,540
 Mr. Confident. But she was like, at one point, she's like, Justin, you are so nervous right now.

213
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,820
 Like she could tell how nervous I was. And I thought I was like keeping it all together. And

214
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:25,380
 it just reminded me of like, I'd been in gyms from the time I was in grade nine all the way

215
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,260
 through college. It wasn't like it was unfamiliar, but I was nervous because I was unfamiliar.

216
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:38,420
 There had been a seven year gap. And now I was like exploring this again, worried about what these

217
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,780
 people are thinking about me. Wow, that guy looks like he's way more fit than me. You know, like all

218
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:52,260
 these thoughts go through your head. And so, yeah, I think kind of figuring out how you can like make

219
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,980
 a step. And sometimes maybe it's like going with somebody. So you at least have some emotional

220
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,500
 because it's emotional. It's nice to have someone to kind of share the emotional burden, right?

221
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,580
 For sure. Well, if you come, the thing that ultimately what you're looking to do is,

222
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,660
 like we just said, feel like it's part of your territory. And because there are other people

223
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,220
 in that space, what that also means is you're looking to feel like you're part of the tribe

224
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,220
 who goes there, right? That you belong with the other people who are in that room.

225
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,620
 And so it helps to what is a tribe? Well, it's a group of people that you get along with,

226
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,340
 that you bond with, that you belong to over something else, over some shared interest.

227
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,460
 And in other words, it's a group in a lot of ways of friends, friends who share some kind of

228
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,900
 interest. So these are your gym friends. Well, if you go with your wife, then you automatically

229
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,380
 have at least one person in the tribe that you are friends with, that you do belong with.

230
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,140
 And so I think that helps you get over that hurdle a little bit. You're no longer facing

231
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:01,060
 that challenge alone. Before it was like, I am trying to get fit. Now it is we are trying

232
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:07,940
 to get fit. And that helps a lot with the kind of the mental feeling of like, do I belong or not?

233
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,820
 Yeah. I've also found, sorry, I don't mean to stay on this too long, but it's so fresh

234
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:20,580
 that the other thing I found myself doing, because I'm interested in the emotional friction behind

235
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,860
 habits. And so the other thing I was doing is I was going in there and I'm uncomfortable.

236
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:33,460
 So I'm trying to act really tough, but I'm not tough at all. I'm like, but I'm, you know,

237
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,180
 when people look at me, I'm kind of like scowling when like, I'm not being friendly. I'm not being

238
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:47,060
 myself. And I was thinking about that and thinking like, when you're kind of inward focused

239
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,020
 and you're in a new environment and you're trying to develop a new habit, but you're inward focused,

240
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,700
 it really is, it doesn't really help. And so I had to kind of turn that around and go, okay,

241
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,660
 I got to start being friendly. I got to start saying hi to these people, because if I wave at

242
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:09,060
 this person and it feels good, like they respond with a smile and that happens again next time.

243
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,820
 And again, next time, that's a little bit of a reward for me. That's going to keep me going to

244
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,380
 the gym. But if I keep going here with this like tough scowl on my face, you know, and it's hard

245
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:29,620
 because you feel like you don't belong, you feel nervous and you kind of default to these weird

246
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:37,300
 behaviors. And it took a little bit of time, but I realized, okay, now I got to get in the habit of

247
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,740
 smiling and saying hello when I'm in the gym, not just being like in my own zone and pretending I'm

248
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,860
 somebody I'm not. Right? Well, that's one thing that kind of helps you start to belong with or

249
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,020
 become part of the rest of the tribe. You know, like just a friendly behavior helps you start

250
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,580
 to develop friendships with some of those other people that are there. There was a study that I

251
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,060
 wanted to cite in Atomic Habits, but I couldn't find it to track it down, but I read about it

252
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:10,500
 years ago where the YMCA ran a survey. And when they surveyed people who were joining the gym,

253
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,180
 the thing that got them to join were the different classes offered, the equipment that was in the

254
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,060
 gym, basically facilities and features were the things that got people in for the first time.

255
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,220
 But then when they surveyed members who had been there for over a year, the thing that got people

256
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:31,300
 to stick, nobody mentioned features or facilities, everybody mentioned friendships. And so the people

257
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,620
 who actually stayed at the gym or kept their membership were the ones who ended up developing

258
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,020
 friendships with other people there. And I think you're right. Ultimately, the thing that gets you

259
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,340
 to come back is like, do I enjoy coming here? Does it mean I get to see some of my friends? Does it

260
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,140
 mean I get to hang out with people I like? Or, you know, it's really the sense of belonging that

261
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,620
 gets habits to stick. And the action itself is just kind of like something that's happening along

262
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:01,060
 the way. Yes. But there's a step before that that we kind of skipped over, which is like, how do you

263
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:08,420
 even choose a habit in the first place? Like, how does that happen in the sense of I might not know

264
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:17,380
 what's good for me? So how does that come into this? Yeah, well, there are a lot of ways to

265
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,180
 answer that question. So I'll just share a couple thoughts that come to mind. So the first thought

266
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,340
 that comes to mind is this question from I first heard from Seth Godin, which I think is just a

267
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,700
 great question, which is what is it for? And so this is a question that we need to ask ourselves

268
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,780
 when we're trying to build a new habit, which is what is this habit for? What is that? What am I

269
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,980
 actually trying to achieve here? Because the correct habit to choose is very different based

270
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,860
 on what your goals are, what you're hoping to get as an outcome, what kind of lifestyle you want.

271
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:54,100
 And, you know, so for example, the habit of making 20 sales calls a day. Well, if what it's for is to

272
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,940
 increase revenue, and to build a successful business, that's a wonderful thing. If you hate

273
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,180
 making sales calls, and you want to spend less time working and more time with your family,

274
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:10,820
 that could be a terrible habit to build. It just depends on what it's for. So that's one question

275
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:18,100
 to ask. But you are correct that we often don't know what we need in the moment. And I think part

276
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,060
 of that's just a challenge of life and a challenge of self awareness and you know, knowing what you

277
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:29,300
 need. But life is a very complex system. And so figuring out the right thing for that is sometimes

278
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:36,900
 it's just impossible or too many moving parts. So I tend to default to two possible answers.

279
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,700
 The first answer is we all need things that are so boring that we don't think about them,

280
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,300
 but are incredibly important for showing up each day. So did you sleep eight hours? Are you drinking

281
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,300
 enough water? Are you spending a little bit of time walking outside or getting a little bit of

282
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:57,540
 sunlight? Do you exercise consistently? Whatever form is interesting to you? Are you spending some

283
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,420
 time reading and soaking up new ideas? Now, I'm not saying you have to do all that stuff every day.

284
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,060
 But my point is like, those are things that most people would be like, yeah, of course,

285
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,940
 you should sleep and read more books and exercise. Everybody knows that's good. But your time is

286
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,860
 almost never going to be wasted by making sure you do one of those things. It's a fundamental

287
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,420
 that's worth spending time on, that's worth coming back to, that's worth reminding yourself of,

288
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:28,340
 even if you aren't sure the ideal perfect place to focus in your life. So that's the first answer.

289
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:35,220
 Come back to the fundamentals. The second answer is more broad. I can't be specific with it because

290
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,860
 it depends on each person. But the broad application is what I would call broad funnel tight filter.

291
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,700
 So whenever you're trying to figure out where to focus, you need a really broad range of research,

292
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:54,020
 try to get as many options as possible, then apply a really tight, strict filter to it,

293
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:00,980
 and just focus on the one or two best options that you found. So for example, I just finished

294
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,140
 Atomic Habits a few months ago. So now I'm thinking, should I write a second book? If I should,

295
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,660
 what should that be about? And I don't know right now. So I'm in the broad funnel stage. So I want

296
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,300
 to lay out as many options as possible. I want to brainstorm a thousand titles. I want to look at

297
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,580
 all the top books on Amazon. I want to browse my best performing tweets and see if there's a possible

298
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,140
 thread for a book idea in there. I want to look everywhere I can and just list all of that stuff

299
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,820
 in the same spreadsheet. And maybe I got 1200 ideas on there, really broad funnel. But then

300
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,780
 I need to apply a very tight filter. Is this something I'm interested in enough to spend

301
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,980
 two or three or four years working on? Is it a topic of broad appeal to a general audience?

302
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,540
 Are there going to be a lot of people that like this? Is this something that people,

303
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,700
 that I can actually turn into something actionable? You know, like can people use this in their daily

304
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,220
 life? Is this a topic that has a lot of stories that I could tell? Right? Can I actually make this

305
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,460
 entertaining or, you know, latch on to other interesting stories to make the book readable?

306
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,540
 Yes. So, you know, and those are just some of the filters, but they're, my point is that

307
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,580
 you want some period of very broad exploration. And then once you have a lot of options,

308
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,540
 you want to really tighten it down based on that question. What is this for? So in my case,

309
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,500
 the question I'm using is, well, it's for writing a good book, one that's highly actionable, one that

310
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,020
 sells a lot of copies, one that people find useful and so on. And so I think if you combine

311
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,980
 that broad funnel type filter strategy and that question of what is it for, that can maybe give

312
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,820
 you some more specific answers. But even if you don't come up with something good there,

313
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,500
 you can always focus on the fundamentals. Yeah. And the other thing, when you mentioned Seth Godin,

314
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:46,420
 he has this other line, which is people like us do things like this. I love that line. I wish I

315
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:53,700
 thought it up, but yeah, it's so good. It's such a great mantra. And what's interesting about it

316
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:01,620
 is, like for me, one thing that made me start thinking about healthy habits was

317
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:10,740
 hanging out with people who had healthy habits. And in some ways it was really lucky and fortunate.

318
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:20,100
 Like you guys invited me to that retreat you did. Yep. And in some ways I'm thankful you

319
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,060
 guys invited a loser like me, because I was hanging out in that group. I came and at first

320
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:34,900
 I was cynical and grumpy. And eventually, just looking around that group, I realized, man, these

321
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:41,780
 people like this do things like this. And my cynicism, which before would have been like,

322
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,860
 wow, people like that do stuff like that. It went down and then all of a sudden I was like, okay,

323
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:56,580
 well, if people like this do things like this, that's what I need to do. And I think for folks

324
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:04,340
 that are thinking like, okay, well, how do I know what good habits are? There are so many things

325
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:12,180
 that I would have never been, you know, what do you call it? There's like the stages of habits or

326
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,380
 whatever. But I would have never even had the cue if I had not first observed it and then noticed

327
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,940
 like, oh, wait, they're doing that, they're doing that, they're doing that. I'm the odd man out.

328
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:29,460
 And that's what motivated me to want to pursue some of that stuff. But if I hadn't been in that

329
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:36,420
 group and felt like, wait, wait a second, like, if I want to belong here, I've got to up my game,

330
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:42,740
 right? It would have never happened. And so people like us do things like this has been

331
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,860
 really helpful for me. Yeah, I love that phrase. And one of the reasons I said that, oh, I wish

332
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,700
 I had thought that up is because I think it applies so deeply to a lot of the ideas in atomic habits.

333
00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:00,820
 It applies to how socially reinforced our habits are. I think this is, you know, I wrote about this

334
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,780
 in the book. I mean, I have a whole chapter on it. Chapter nine is all about that. But I think I

335
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:12,100
 still undersold the importance of how socially reinforced our habits are. And then it also

336
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:18,100
 references this, the importance of a shared identity. I think that ultimately a shared

337
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,340
 identity is really one of the most powerful forces for getting habits to stick. You know,

338
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:28,580
 like if you look at if you look at it in a big way, you can look at like religions, you know,

339
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,940
 people, religions are really interesting places to look for habits. People get in the habit of

340
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:41,220
 going to church every Sunday for 50 years, largely because it's reinforced. The other people in their

341
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:47,540
 neighborhoods go, the people on their block go, they see their friends there. They it's a very

342
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,860
 socially reinforced habit. Same thing is true in smaller ways. Like let's say you move into a new

343
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,900
 house and you walk outside on Tuesday night and you see all your neighbors have their recycling

344
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,860
 bins out. And you're like, huh, people like us do things like this. Like people who live in this

345
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:09,380
 neighborhood recycle on Tuesday nights. I guess we need to sign up for recycling. And there are

346
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:15,220
 really almost an infinite range of examples that are like that, both large and small, where our

347
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,180
 habits are we notice them because the people around us are doing them, which is what the Q

348
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:26,260
 portion is you referenced. We desire to do them. We crave to follow through on them because by

349
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,860
 doing the same, we fit in or signal to the other people around us. Hey, I get it. I'm part of the

350
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:38,340
 tribe too. It becomes easier to do it because sometimes you have friends helping you out.

351
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,140
 You know, like it's like having a spotter at the gym, like, oh, people like us to help each other

352
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,540
 out when a set is hard. And then ultimately it becomes satisfying because you enjoy being

353
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,700
 praised for it. You know, other people are like, Hey, it was great to see you at church on Sunday

354
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:00,980
 or no really good job on that workout today. And that feels good to be praised for fitting in.

355
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:10,180
 And so in that way, socially reinforced habits or the collective identity, it hits all four stages

356
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:17,620
 of habit formation. And I knew that when I was writing it, but I don't think I gave it as much

357
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,540
 importance as I should have. It's a very powerful driver of behavior in the long run.

358
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:33,700
 Yeah, totally. And I think this is why cynicism is such a toxic attitude. And, you know, I guess

359
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:40,820
 I'm in gen X. I'm born in 1980. There's a lot of cynicism in gen X and then millennials also have

360
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,060
 a little bit of this too. And I think, and actually to be honest, everybody has a baby boomers have it

361
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:52,980
 when, you know, if you're a 50 year old programmer and you're, you get hired at a startup where the

362
00:33:52,980 --> 00:34:02,660
 CEO is 20 years old, then we kind of default to cynicism. And it, it, it's such a blocker when

363
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,460
 you're like trying to observe those norms, like, oh wait, like people like us do things like this.

364
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,620
 Cynicism allows you to go, well, yeah, people like that do stuff like that. That's good for them.

365
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:22,500
 That's good for James Clear, but you know, that's not good for me. And when I'm trying to kind of

366
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,980
 reveal from my experience for anyone that ever watches this or listens to this is that you really

367
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:37,460
 do need to step outside that and at least be open to this idea that your life could get better.

368
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:44,100
 And it could just be going, okay, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna vote for who I'm going to be today. And

369
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,060
 I'm going to vote for who I'm going to be tomorrow. And I'm going to keep going. The other thing in

370
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,740
 the book that really helped me and I'm probably going to butcher it. So you clean up after I do

371
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:59,380
 it, but you show this grid. So imagine like on this side of your day, it's like, okay, I make a

372
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,100
 good decision. So it goes up and then I make another good decision, goes up, but then I make

373
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,820
 a bad decision. Like I eat a tub of ice cream and you know, sometimes eating the tub of ice cream is

374
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:19,380
 like debilitating. It's like, well, I'm done. I ate the tub ice cream. I suck at this. I'm just

375
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,660
 going to go get into bed and forget about it. And in your grid, you show, wait, but you're still up

376
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:31,220
 here. Like you can just make another good decision and then you're back up again. And I like that idea

377
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,740
 of kind of navigating your ideas, not being so hard on ourselves. Did I kind of get that right?

378
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,700
 Yeah. I, so this is the, I don't know if you can see it, but this is the image.

379
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,140
 But it's, it's a, it's this idea that like the difference between a good day and a bad day is

380
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,100
 often just a series of choices, right? And you can win each little moment, right? You can win

381
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,420
 each decisive moment just because you ate the tub of ice cream. Doesn't mean you can't win the next

382
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:05,940
 moment. And, and so one thing that I was thinking about when I wrote that is this concept that I

383
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,620
 call decisive moments. This idea that there are a few choices each day, maybe somewhere between say

384
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:17,540
 five and 10 that kind of determine the next chunk of time. And so, so for example, there's a moment

385
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:23,940
 for me each morning where I sit down and either I open up Evernote and I start writing the next

386
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:31,220
 article I'm going to work on, or I go to ESPN and I check the latest sports news. And what happens

387
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:36,260
 in the next hour is really determined by what happens in like the first 45 seconds. You know,

388
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:42,980
 like do I, do I go to Evernote or do I go to ESPN? And so that is a decisive moment in my language.

389
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,700
 That's like a moment that determines if I can master those 45 seconds, then I can end up

390
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,980
 mastering the next hour that comes afterward almost automatically. Same thing is true. There's

391
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,740
 a moment each night, like 5.15 or so my wife gets home from work and either we change into our workout

392
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:04,580
 clothes or we like sit on the couch and watch reruns the office and order Indian food or whatever.

393
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,260
 And both of those nights are good nights, but the moment to master is do we change into our

394
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,820
 workout clothes or not? If we do that, it only takes a few minutes. Everything else for the next

395
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,820
 two hours is already decided. We'll get in the car, we'll drive to the gym, we'll do the reps.

396
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:24,260
 Like it's all, it's all pretty much done at that point. So the reason I like bringing that up or

397
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:30,820
 like thinking about that is you start to realize there really isn't that much that you need to

398
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,740
 master. Really, you just are trying to focus your attention on a few key decisive moments

399
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,860
 throughout the day. It's kind of like applying judo to your life. It's like apply the pressure

400
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,260
 and the leverage at just the right point and then the next hour kind of falls into place automatically.

401
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:52,180
 And so I like that because once you realize that, once you kind of identify those high leverage

402
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:59,860
 decision points, you can organize your day and your environment around those things. If I know

403
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:06,420
 that those 45 seconds where I'm choosing between Evernote or ESPN is a real key moment, well,

404
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:13,300
 I could install Freedom and then I could block ESPN from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and that takes care

405
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,060
 of that decisive moment and it increases the odds that I'm going to open Evernote instead.

406
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,060
 But anyway, so little choices like that are easier to make once you've identified some of

407
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,220
 those key points of leverage. Yeah, and you talk in the book, like there's some tricks too

408
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:36,980
 where you can make things automatic. Like you talk about Neera Yal buying a little device that just

409
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,500
 shuts off his internet every night at 10. Yeah, outlet timer. Yeah, and what's brilliant about

410
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,540
 that is like it shuts it off, especially if it's in the basement or whatever. You're not going to

411
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:54,020
 go downstairs and fiddle around with it. And then it's just, that's what happens, right?

412
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,740
 If you like, if ESPN was really killing you, you could just cancel your cable subscription.

413
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,940
 That might be a bit, but then you would, you go to watch ESPN, you can't, right? It's done.

414
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,020
 By the way, you mentioned this in the book too, but it's so funny how certain people's,

415
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,100
 what is a trigger for some people is not for others. Like ESPN for me is not a,

416
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,660
 that's not a temptation at all. Yeah, it doesn't even enter your worldview.

417
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:28,180
 Doesn't enter my worldview, but it shows you how identity is so much a part of this. Like if I was

418
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:34,260
 hanging out with a bunch of Oilers fans every single day, and this happened in the cowork office,

419
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,940
 you know, there's a few people and they're watching Oilers games, you know, on their computers.

420
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,220
 And I realized like, if I want to talk to them, I've got to start watching Oilers games.

421
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,460
 So people like us do things like this. And so I started developing this habit of watching

422
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,980
 Oilers games when before I didn't even care. I think, I mean, I think this is one of the reasons

423
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,100
 why sports is so tribal. Why people get so emotional about it is that it becomes a

424
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,900
 connection point for the relationships. It's not even the, the game is actually,

425
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,580
 no one would ever say that because everybody acts like the game is the thing that matters the most.

426
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,620
 But in a weird way, it's kind of a secondary thing, you know, really like when I think back for me,

427
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,220
 sports is a way for my brother and I to connect and for us to have something to text about and

428
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,300
 chat about throughout the week. It's a thing that, you know, it's a reason for my dad and I

429
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,260
 to get together in person and to go to games and hang out. And like it's, it's all the other stuff

430
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,740
 that it provides that makes it so deeply meaningful. And then you, you know, you end up assigning a lot

431
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,220
 of that emotion to how the team does on the field as well with the scores on the scoreboard. But,

432
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,140
 yeah, you're, it's a good example there. On that topic then, and this is Corey Stone is asking this

433
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:50,100
 in chat, but there's a lot of people on Twitter that asked this too. Given that example that you

434
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:57,700
 just gave, if your meaningful relationships are engaging in habits that might not be good for you

435
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:04,340
 or that you want to change, how do you navigate that? So if you're really feeling like I gotta,

436
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:10,020
 I gotta stop watching sports, it's just like I get a little bit and then I just go crazy,

437
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,860
 but I still want to have a relationship with my brother. This is where it gets complex,

438
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:21,620
 especially if you're married to somebody. Like if your wife is, is like, your wife is at least

439
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:26,900
 somewhat inclined to want to go to the gym, I'm guessing. But if she was like, no, I just want

440
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:32,180
 to watch Netflix and order Indian food. That's all I want to do. How do you start to navigate those

441
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:39,140
 things? Yeah, those are good questions. I mean, it's really hard because especially if it's a

442
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,780
 person who you want to stay in your life, you know, I think first of all, I just want to say,

443
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:49,940
 so I have some things I want to add to this, but I feel like it's worth noting that this question

444
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:56,580
 comes up a lot. And I think the reason it comes up a lot is because we all know that actually there

445
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,820
 isn't a good easy answer. And that it's like just a hard part of life. You know what I mean? Like

446
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,540
 everybody wants, it's one of those things we want to keep asking about in hopes that, oh, maybe

447
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,700
 there'll be an easy way to resolve this. But I think we all know like it's a challenge.

448
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,500
 Now that said, there are a few things you can do. So first thing is sometimes your friends and

449
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,700
 family want to do something different than how you want to change. So like you're, you want to

450
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:28,020
 stick to a new diet. They want to eat the old way or something like that. Well, you want to start

451
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,500
 doing yoga. They couldn't care less about yoga. They don't want to go to class with you, things

452
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:38,580
 like that. Well, if that's the case, then for certain habits, you don't have to like fire your

453
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,940
 friends and family to be able to do that. But what you can't, what you do need or what can be really

454
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:50,180
 useful is having like a sacred space where that occurs, where I'm not saying you need to do this

455
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,980
 with me, but just don't make it harder on me, right? Just don't conflict with. So, you know,

456
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:00,660
 the yoga example is an easier one where it's like, well, maybe you need to go to a yoga studio away

457
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,700
 from the friends and family that aren't interested and start to build friendships with people who

458
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,460
 are, you know, I'm not saying you need to get rid of your old friends, but maybe it'd be helpful to

459
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,780
 build a couple of new ones who are into yoga so that you have like a safe space for that habit

460
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:20,660
 to live. So that's one thing. Then there's the second piece, which is sometimes you're building

461
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:26,340
 a habit that you do want the person to like join you on, to come along with you. You know, you're

462
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,580
 working out and you would love for your spouse to join you at the gym or something like that.

463
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,980
 And everybody knows, like it would be good, but they feel, maybe they feel less comfortable there

464
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:42,660
 than you do, or maybe they feel, you know, you were previously an athlete and they were not.

465
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,980
 And so you feel kind of comfortable in the gym. You've been there before in years past, but for

466
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,500
 them, it's like new and weird. And, you know, they feel like they're being judged and whatever.

467
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,260
 Mm-hmm. If you're dealing with a case like that, the thing that I try to keep in mind,

468
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,540
 and I can tell you from working with my own family, it can be incredibly useful is praise

469
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:08,100
 the good, ignore the bad. It's very hard to do. It's very, the difficult part about it is not doing

470
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,620
 it on an individual basis. It's that this needs to be the new lifestyle for you. So when they do the

471
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:18,900
 thing that you're asking them to do, don't, basically another way to phrase this is don't

472
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,860
 criticize people for doing what you were hoping they would, you know? Like there are so many times

473
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,740
 when the introverted kid in the family will come down to the dinner table and it's like, oh, look

474
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:34,180
 who decided to join us. And it's like, well, they finally did the thing that you were hoping they

475
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:39,060
 would do and engage with everybody. And now they just feel like they're getting criticized for it.

476
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:46,340
 Or you go to the gym and your spouse decides to join you and they do a few sets and then they

477
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,460
 feel like they're done. And you say, well, that was a pretty short workout. And what you should

478
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,020
 be saying is, I think it's great that you got in here tonight, right? Like you weren't feeling it,

479
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:02,660
 but you were still able to make it in. And so praise the good, ignore the bad. And if you can

480
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:09,700
 do that in the long run, what ends up happening is everybody likes feeling praised. Everybody likes

481
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:15,940
 feeling rewarded. They like to, it feels satisfying to do something that the people who love you and

482
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:21,460
 who are around you praise you for. And so at first you go to the gym and they say, hey, I'm really

483
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,940
 proud of you for getting in here tonight. Good job. And it doesn't seem like much, but then after two

484
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:31,460
 months and three months and 10 months of that, you turn around a year later and they might never even

485
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,900
 say it, but implicitly what they've realized is damn, every time I go to the gym, it feels good.

486
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,340
 They like, they compliment me. And that, so now all of a sudden you start to associate going to the gym

487
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:48,180
 with feeling good. And this is a really long game play because it takes a while for that to

488
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:55,140
 reinforce itself. But, you know, same thing like the introverted kid at the table sits down and

489
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,500
 they say something that happened today and it's like, oh, that's awesome. Thanks for sharing that

490
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,380
 with us. You know, I'm like on that individual night, that one night at dinner doesn't count for

491
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:09,300
 a lot, but if every time they speak up, they're rewarded for it, then all of a sudden now they

492
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,260
 have a reason to start doing that more in the months and years to come. So it takes a while,

493
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,660
 but I think that that's like an effective way to gradually nudge people in the right direction.

494
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,340
 Yeah. There's someone in the chat that's saying they need to apply that idea to

495
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,260
 themselves to avoid feeling guilty for not doing enough. So instead of reinforce, oh, you idiot,

496
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:34,100
 you didn't go to the gym again, you fatty. You know, like that's not helpful. There's the

497
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:40,340
 self-talk. It can work with self-talk as well. This is why I think small habits can be so useful

498
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:45,060
 in some ways, even on the bad days, because like, let's say you're in that situation you just said

499
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:50,660
 where it's like, oh, you know, skip the gym again. Well, you can still do one push-up or one air

500
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:55,700
 squat or whatever before you go do a set of 10 air squats before you hop in bed tonight. And

501
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,300
 it's not going to transform your body, but that's not really the point. The point is to prove to

502
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,580
 yourself that it wasn't a good day. I didn't have the best motivation or energy. I had a long day

503
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:12,420
 at work, but I still am not the type of person who misses workouts, right? I still prove to myself,

504
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,860
 I still cast a vote for being that kind of person. I didn't let a day go by without doing nothing.

505
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:24,660
 And that can count for a lot in the long run. And so sometimes small habits are less about

506
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,260
 the outcome they deliver and more about the identity they reinforce.

507
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:35,220
 Yeah. And I've actually found, you know, another thing I tried to, I'm implementing

508
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:42,660
 in the new year is I decided to quit drinking alcohol. And right now it's ostensibly for this

509
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:48,660
 goal of hitting a revenue mark. Once I hit the goal, then I can have a drink. But the deeper

510
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,980
 motivation for me was I just realized like, it just makes it a depressant. It's like, there's a

511
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:02,580
 bunch of reasons that it's not good for me. And so my excuse or my way of trying it out is saying,

512
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,460
 well, I'm going for this goal, but it's been interesting in social situations because all

513
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:14,740
 my friends still drink and that's fine with me. But sometimes just sharing the goal, oh,

514
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,860
 I'm just doing this because I'm going after this thing. And you talk about how goals are sometimes

515
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:26,020
 helpful in setting your direction. You know, like, okay, I'm pointed this way now. And

516
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:31,060
 sometimes sharing that with people is helpful. The other thing is I think eventually, if I just

517
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:38,580
 keep doing this, just for me to say, well, I'm a non-drinker now. Yeah. And so I can still go and

518
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:46,260
 have my favorite. And it's also nice having a thing that you like. So my favorite non-alcoholic drink

519
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:53,940
 is a non-alcoholic Caesar. It's like a Bloody Mary. And to have that drink, it's like kind of spicy.

520
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:00,340
 There's a reward there. I also have this social crutch that I can use in the situation,

521
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:06,500
 you know, and if somebody asks me about it, I also have this new identity, which is, oh,

522
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,700
 I'm a non-drinker now. I just don't drink. And you talked about that. There's some research behind

523
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,420
 that. I know you've mentioned it a lot, but it's like, I'm trying to quit smoking versus I'm a

524
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:23,940
 non-smoker. Right? Is that correct? Correct. Yeah. So I think that that can be really helpful.

525
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,700
 I think what you're explaining here, the situation that you're going through,

526
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,500
 this experience you're having is kind of it's illustrating this process of identity change,

527
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,260
 right? It started with, oh, I'm just going to put it off for a little while while I'm attacking this

528
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,740
 goal. But then you're casting so many votes for like, you know what? I haven't drank and like,

529
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,740
 I'm kind of benefiting from it. Like maybe this is part of my identity now. Maybe I'm a non-drinker.

530
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,180
 So anyway, yeah, I think you're definitely on the right track there. Yeah. And actually,

531
00:49:54,180 --> 00:50:02,100
 this is a good time to bring up two Twitter questions. Maria Aldry asks, you know, how do

532
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:07,540
 you maintain habits? Ask him about maintaining habits for people with depression, anxiety,

533
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:15,460
 or attention deficit. Do you want to try to tackle that? Yeah. So I've tried to be careful

534
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,420
 about saying that atomic habits is about building habits and breaking bad habits, building good ones.

535
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,540
 But it's not a book on addiction. It's not a book on depression. It's not a book about anxiety or

536
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:33,220
 ADHD or any of these other disorders or ailments. And I don't consider myself an expert on addiction.

537
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:39,540
 However, something interesting has happened. So I published the book and I have had a ton of

538
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,540
 speaking requests recently. And so I've been doing speeches at conferences and companies and

539
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:49,700
 different events and whatever. And so many times I get someone that comes up to me afterward or

540
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:56,260
 that asks a question during Q&A that talks about how useful the book was for their son who had ADHD

541
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,300
 or their cousin was a meth addict and then was able to like start to, you know, write the ship

542
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,020
 by employing some of these techniques or whatever. Yeah. Which is great, which is very gratifying.

543
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:10,740
 I still stand by my original statement. I'm not an expert on addiction. I don't want to like take

544
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:16,260
 a strong stance with this stuff. But what I've realized is that the principles that I lay out

545
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:22,260
 in atomic habits are really about how human behavior works. It's about how habits are formed

546
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:28,580
 and whether that habit is something extreme like an addiction or picking your skin or OCD or ADHD

547
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:33,940
 or whatever. Or whether it's something more moderate like meditating for three minutes a day.

548
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:40,820
 The fundamentals tend to be similar. And so I'm not going to say that the book offers a prescription

549
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,500
 for overcoming addictions. But what I will say is you'd be hard pressed to find tactics in the book

550
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,500
 that wouldn't at least help, right? That wouldn't at least nudge people in the right direction.

551
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:58,340
 I have heard from a few readers who specifically have said that they had ADHD and that they found

552
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:03,540
 the book very helpful. Environment design for whatever reason has been something that's come

553
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:08,980
 up multiple times for folks who have struggled with that. So I think it's kind of like if you're

554
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:14,740
 the type of person who is less likely to just remember to do it, right? Or just follow your

555
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:21,220
 to-do list. If that's not you, then structuring an environment where it's easier to see the cues of

556
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:27,460
 your good habits, less likely to see the distractions, less friction between you and the good behavior,

557
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:32,740
 more friction between you and the bad ones. If you place yourself in that space, it's much more

558
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:37,940
 likely that you're going to fall through. So those are things that I talk about in chapters 6 and 12.

559
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:43,780
 But I think that the book applies. But I don't pitch it as like a prescription for someone

560
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,660
 dealing with a more serious issue. Totally. Yeah. And I would say, again, I'm not an expert

561
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:53,700
 either, but as someone who has been dealing with depression the past couple of years,

562
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,860
 having a professional that you go to that deals with this stuff all the time like a therapist

563
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:09,940
 is so helpful. And the therapist will be very interested if you read James's book.

564
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:15,460
 So I said to my therapist, I'm like, you know, she starts way back here. And then she says,

565
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,900
 so what's new with you? I'm like, well, you know, I read this book and I'm thinking, oh,

566
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:24,180
 what are you thinking about doing with that? Oh, I'm thinking about maybe quitting alcohol. Oh,

567
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:28,020
 well, that's, you know, there's some reinforcement from the professionals.

568
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:35,940
 And likewise with my doctor, you know, when I had depression and I went to my physician,

569
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:46,020
 she said, she gave me two prescriptions, quit drinking alcohol and quit taking any kind of

570
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:53,460
 cannabis. And the reason is she says those are going to make you feel bad. Now the trigger in

571
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,300
 that case was my doctor. It's nice when you have a doctor saying, listen, this is your prescription.

572
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:04,500
 Oh, and double the amount of exercise I was doing. So three things. Those, so I did that for three

573
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,780
 months and then, you know, I went back to my old habits, but now I have that memory of what it was

574
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:15,380
 like for three months. And it's been a powerful trigger for me to, you know, when I am starting

575
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:21,380
 to notice my mood go down, I can, I remembered, you know, my doctor's prescription was quit

576
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:28,100
 drinking, quit, you know, eating edibles and doubling my exercise. And that's been helpful

577
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:33,140
 for me personally. So I think if you're reading the book, let your professional in your life know

578
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:40,900
 about it is good. And one thing I want you to do is, cause I love the imagery, but, and this is

579
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,780
 probably unfair to you, is to give the ice cube example, but use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.

580
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:56,820
 So this is an example from the first chapter of the book. And I actually, as a side note,

581
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,860
 I thought about this. I was like, man, we're going to have to get these change for the foreign

582
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:04,260
 additions. Like we're going to, it's going to need to be, but anyway, so yeah, yeah. The,

583
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:10,740
 the core idea is that the process of changing your habits is, well, it's similar to what we

584
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:15,380
 talked about early on, that there's often this valley of death, that there's this period where

585
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,780
 you're just kind of building up latent potential, but you're not really releasing any other results

586
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:25,460
 yet. And I like to equate it to the process of heating up an ice cube, you know? So you've got,

587
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,780
 you've got this ice cube sitting on the table, right? And so let's say it's like negative three

588
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:35,300
 degrees in there, right? So you're, you're a negative three, it's cold. You can see your breath.

589
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,580
 The ice cube sitting there, you heat it up negative two, negative one. Still there's this ice cube

590
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:46,100
 sitting there. Nothing has happened. Right. Then you go from negative one to zero. And all of a

591
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:51,700
 sudden you have this one degree shift, no different than any of the other shifts that came before it,

592
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:58,340
 but you have this phase transition, right? And like the ice cube starts melting. And that I think is

593
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,220
 indicative of what it often feels like to change a habit. You're making these little improvements.

594
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:09,300
 You're trying to make these 1% changes, these one degree shifts each day. And you're like,

595
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,940
 it's really easy to get frustrated or even depressed at that point. You know, it's like,

596
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,460
 I've been running for three weeks. How come I can't see a change in my body? You know,

597
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,620
 or I've been writing blog posts for six months now. How come this site isn't popular yet?

598
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:27,140
 And the key point there is your work was not being wasted. It's just being stored.

599
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:32,580
 Yeah. Complaining about sticking to a habit for two months or three months or even six months

600
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:37,140
 or a year and not having the outcome that you want is kind of like complaining about heating an

601
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,220
 ice cube from negative three to negative one degrees and it not melting yet. You know, like

602
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:47,620
 the work was not wasted. It's just being stored. And I love that quote that's in that same section

603
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:53,940
 from Jacob Reese who it hangs in the locker room with the San Antonio, who won five NBA championships.

604
00:56:53,940 --> 00:57:00,900
 And it says essentially, when I feel like giving up, I think about the stone cutter who continues

605
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,860
 to hammer away at the stone a hundred times without it splitting. And then finally on the

606
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,820
 hundred and first blow, it cracks in two. And I know that it wasn't the hundred that can't there.

607
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:14,020
 I know it wasn't the hundred and first swing that did it, but the hundred that came before.

608
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:21,140
 And like it's that same idea. You know, the reason the site takes off is not because of the one viral

609
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:27,060
 article. It's because of the 55 that you wrote in the weeks and months prior. The reason that you see

610
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:31,780
 a change in your body is not because today's workout radically transform you. It's because

611
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:38,100
 you've been sticking to it for eight months now. And it's really about showing up, continue to put

612
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:43,620
 those swings in, continue to raise the temperature by one degree. And eventually you hit that phase

613
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:50,660
 transition where you can see the results of your work. Yeah. And that image has been so powerful

614
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:58,580
 in my life. I've been telling people about this book and I actually notice there's kind of like a

615
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:03,860
 coffee shop test. Like if I hear people talking about something from internet culture in a coffee

616
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:12,820
 shop, like real people, then something's hit and atomic habits is like that. Like it hit the kind

617
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:22,580
 of mainstream and that image of just raising the temperature a little bit every day. Now I feel like

618
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:32,900
 I'm a few months into this and I'm a little bit kind of like evangelical about it. Like I'm saying,

619
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:40,100
 now I'm like, God, like my life is so much better. And it's because of just these little changes over

620
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:47,940
 time in the same direction. I can now I can see it. Now I can see that I feel better. You know, wow,

621
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,340
 man, quitting alcohol, that was one thing. And then wow, showing up at the gym three or four times a

622
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,580
 week, that really helps. And wow, like reading a real book every night before I go to bed,

623
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:03,460
 all of these things keep kind of adding up and do make a meaningful difference in your life.

624
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,220
 Even though way back when, when you're starting, you feel like, well, nothing's going to help

625
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:16,100
 me now. I want to be clear that these ideas have meaningfully impacted my life.

626
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:21,060
 So I'm yeah, I'm really thankful. I'm thankful you wrote that book. I'm thankful you

627
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,660
 talked to me in the airport. It's been really great for me.

628
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,700
 That's awesome. Thank you so much for sharing that. And ultimately that's what the whole thing

629
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:34,180
 is for, right? I mean, it just, it makes it feel like it was worth the effort to spend a few years

630
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:39,940
 writing it and working on it. So that's great. So before you go, some people are asking like

631
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:45,620
 what recommendations for system services, tools, trackers, I know you have a new one coming out.

632
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:49,860
 Do you want to talk about that? Sure. Yeah. So I got it right here next to me, actually. So this

633
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:57,300
 is a habit journal and we, we just launched it two weeks ago and it's got, it's basically a

634
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,740
 doc grid notebook. So if you're into bullet journaling or you're into keeping a notebook

635
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:05,380
 or use a notebook, the vast majority of it are doc grid pages. So you'll be able to use it like

636
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:10,900
 any normal one. But then at the back, there's a section with a habit tracker templates. And

637
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:14,420
 I don't know if you can see that very well, but I've been using it. For example, this is this

638
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:21,060
 month. So you can see me tracking my habits on here. And so anyway, those templates are in the

639
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,820
 back and they're also perforated. So you can tear them out and put them on your desk or put them on

640
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:29,780
 your kitchen counter or your refrigerator or whatever. And then, and then at the very beginning

641
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:36,180
 of the book, there is a section called one line per day. So I've been using it for what happened

642
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:42,420
 today. And so I've been writing down what happened each day and there are 31 lines. So one for each

643
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,740
 day of the month and there are 12 of them. So by the time you get to the end of the year,

644
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:51,140
 you should be able to flip through and see, you know, if you I'm doing what happened today,

645
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:56,660
 Sean Blank does, what's the highlight of the day? Some other ones that I've seen are, you know,

646
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,500
 what am I grateful for? Or you could use it as like a productivity thing. You could say like,

647
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:05,620
 what's my most important task today, things like that. So there are a lot of examples in the back

648
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,500
 of the notebook who I have like 16 pages of examples of how to use it. But, but anyway,

649
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,300
 it's called the habit journal and yeah, I'm excited about it. I think it'll be a good tool

650
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,380
 to help people build better habits. Cool. And a lot of folks, I've heard from a lot of folks that

651
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,220
 really like the audio book. So if you folks aren't readers, go check out the audio book.

652
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:31,780
 People like us read atomic habits. So thanks again for your time, James. Really appreciate it, man.

653
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,380
 Awesome. Thank you.

654
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:49,780
 There you go. Hope that was helpful for you. Like I said, I really recommend the book atomic

655
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:58,900
 habits.com that journal that he's talking about is also available there. Folks, it's 2019. And if

656
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:05,700
 you are tired of bootstrapping alone, I've been running an online community, especially for
