00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Transistor.fm.
00:15.400 --> 00:22.400
Hey product people, Justin Jackson here and I've got a brand new interview for you with
00:22.500 --> 00:29.500
James Clear who is the author of Atomic Habits, a book that has really changed the world.
00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
It's changed my life since I've read it and I don't want to give too much of an intro,
00:36.100 --> 00:42.100
I just want to get right into the actual interview. If you like this, please reach out to James
00:42.200 --> 00:47.700
on Twitter, at James Clear and if you have comments about the episode, reach out to me
00:47.800 --> 00:54.800
on Twitter, I'm the letter M, the letter I, Justin, M-I, Justin. Here is me and James
00:55.300 --> 01:02.300
talking about habits and how you can make your life better one day at a time.
01:09.100 --> 01:13.100
The book, your book's been out for a while, it's right here, Atomic Habits, if you see
01:13.100 --> 01:19.100
it in an airport or something near you. How long has it been out now?
01:19.400 --> 01:21.400
Today is 100 days exactly.
01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
No way!
01:22.400 --> 01:25.400
Yeah, so just over three months.
01:25.400 --> 01:33.400
You know, I'm curious because now it's been out for a while, is there one idea that you
01:34.400 --> 01:39.700
see that people keep sharing, like one idea that resonated from the book in particular
01:39.700 --> 01:44.900
that gets shared more than anything else on Twitter or whatever?
01:44.900 --> 01:49.600
So I was curious about that myself when I was writing the book and thinking about it
01:49.600 --> 01:55.100
because I kind of felt like, alright, hopefully all these ideas are useful, what's the one
01:55.100 --> 01:58.840
thing that people are going to latch onto? Because sometimes you'll hear that from authors
01:58.840 --> 02:05.600
that there was one chapter or something that was the chapter that really stuck with people.
02:05.600 --> 02:12.600
I'm grateful for the fact that there are a variety of things, but there are a few things.
02:12.700 --> 02:17.700
So the first one is Identity-Based Habits, which is chapter two.
02:17.700 --> 02:23.500
And that concept really seems to have resonated with people, the idea of trying to reinforce
02:23.500 --> 02:27.860
your desired identity and starting with who you want to become rather than what you want
02:27.860 --> 02:29.600
to achieve.
02:29.600 --> 02:35.240
And I'm glad that it did because that was the chapter I debated over the most of where
02:35.240 --> 02:36.420
to put it in the book.
02:36.420 --> 02:41.440
I had it at different points. It was the first chapter, it was the last chapter, it ended
02:41.460 --> 02:46.080
up being the second one. I also had this thought in my head that it should be about midway
02:46.080 --> 02:51.240
through the book. So it really jumped all over the place, but I ended up thinking, I
02:51.240 --> 02:55.100
feel like this is one of the best ideas, so I want to have it early so that people, even
02:55.100 --> 03:00.500
if they don't finish the book, they still come across this idea. And I'm glad that that
03:00.500 --> 03:02.980
ended up working out well.
03:02.980 --> 03:08.300
The other one that people bring up a lot is the two-minute rule and the idea of scaling
03:08.320 --> 03:12.960
your habits down to the point where they take two minutes or less. I think that that's a
03:12.960 --> 03:17.760
very actionable one. It's like, okay, I know exactly what to do. I wanted to do a workout,
03:17.760 --> 03:22.880
but now I'll just focus on doing five push-ups. Or I wanted to read 30 books this year and
03:22.880 --> 03:28.040
now I'll focus on reading one page a day or something like that. So I think the actionableness
03:28.040 --> 03:30.840
of that one also tends to stick.
03:30.900 --> 03:39.300
And so going back to the identity one, is this the idea that every action you take or
03:39.300 --> 03:43.500
every habit you develop is a vote for the person you want to become?
03:43.500 --> 03:50.500
Right. So that's kind of like my core philosophy behind it. This idea that the way that we
03:51.660 --> 03:58.660
develop beliefs about ourselves, that we reinforce our self-image, that we develop our identity
03:58.680 --> 04:04.560
to a certain degree, is largely reinforced by the experiences and behaviors that we perform
04:04.560 --> 04:09.600
over time. So some aspects of your identity are relatively fixed. Like, for example, if
04:09.600 --> 04:16.040
you're tall or short. But even that idea that I am tall or I am short, that's reinforced.
04:16.040 --> 04:21.880
You learn that through experiences in life. Now, there are many aspects of your identity
04:21.880 --> 04:28.640
that are less fixed than that, but are still reinforced by your experiences. So if you
04:28.980 --> 04:35.980
write one sentence today, you probably don't think about yourself as, I am a writer. But
04:35.980 --> 04:40.820
if you do that every day for six months or nine months or a year, at some point you turn
04:40.820 --> 04:46.380
around and you think, huh, maybe I am the kind of person who is a writer. Or if you
04:46.380 --> 04:52.460
study biology every Tuesday night for 20 minutes, you at some point think, I guess I'm studious.
04:52.460 --> 04:56.980
I keep doing this every week. Maybe this is the kind of person I am. And so I like that
04:57.000 --> 05:02.400
idea that our habits are like votes for the type of person we believe that we are, that
05:02.400 --> 05:08.720
they build up evidence of looking at ourselves in a certain way. And I like to phrase it
05:08.720 --> 05:13.960
that way, not only because I believe that it's true, but also like beliefs and behavior
05:13.960 --> 05:18.920
are kind of a two way street, right? So like you can, you'll hear people say things like,
05:18.920 --> 05:23.280
well, you know, just be positive or just believe in yourself or fake it till you make it or
05:23.340 --> 05:29.100
things like that. And there's nothing necessarily wrong with fake it till you make it. Like
05:29.100 --> 05:33.980
it's fine to be positive and believe things about yourself. But it's a very short term
05:33.980 --> 05:39.580
strategy because fake it till you make it is asking you to believe something about yourself
05:39.580 --> 05:43.940
without having evidence for it. You know, it's like that kind of visualization stuff
05:43.940 --> 05:46.740
or mantra stuff where you look at yourself in the mirror and you tell yourself, I am
05:46.740 --> 05:52.620
a writer, I am a writer, even though you haven't written yet. And so what I'm saying is similar,
05:53.320 --> 05:58.560
but I think importantly different in the sense that you let the behavior lead the way rather
05:58.560 --> 06:03.800
than the belief. And I think that's the best lever we have for changing the way that we
06:03.800 --> 06:08.600
look at ourselves, which is to say, show up and write a sentence every day. And soon you're
06:08.600 --> 06:13.480
going to have something to root that new identity of I am a writer in. And it gives, it's a
06:13.480 --> 06:17.000
much more, I think, robust and long-term way of changing how you look at yourself.
06:17.060 --> 06:25.900
Yeah, I think for me, the, cause you first communicated that idea to me in an airport
06:25.900 --> 06:33.380
in Denver. Yeah, I remember that. And the, at the time in my life, I was not doing so
06:33.380 --> 06:40.100
good. I was depressed. I was, I think, cynical, especially I think cynical about people like
06:40.100 --> 06:45.780
you that seem to have it all together, that seem to be really like doing all the good
06:45.800 --> 06:52.800
habits. And when you're not doing so good, looking at someone that seems to have it all
06:53.640 --> 07:00.640
together just can make you more grumpy or more cynical or more whatever. But I remember
07:01.040 --> 07:08.040
you sitting down and kind of hashing this out with me and that idea of Justin, no matter
07:08.940 --> 07:15.940
where you're at right now and no matter what you've done, you could start today with one
07:17.940 --> 07:24.940
action. So if you, you know, go running today, that might not make a big difference. But
07:25.140 --> 07:29.980
then if you do it tomorrow and then the next day and then the next day and then the next
07:29.980 --> 07:36.980
day, at the end of the week, you might say, well, wait a second, I think I'm a runner.
07:37.120 --> 07:40.480
Right? And maybe, you know, after a couple of weeks you might say, well, you know, I'm
07:40.480 --> 07:44.120
going to get myself some runner clothes and go and get some runner clothes. And then I'm
07:44.120 --> 07:49.320
going to get myself a good pair of shoes. I'm going to install that Strava app. And
07:49.320 --> 07:54.840
all of a sudden you could see yourself. That was very, that was a really hopeful message
07:54.840 --> 07:59.760
for me when I was really struggling to figure out, it was way easier for me to be cynical
07:59.760 --> 08:05.920
and just kind of look back at all these people implementing good healthy processes and say,
08:05.920 --> 08:11.340
well, that's not for me. That's just for people that whatever, you know, but seeing, hearing
08:11.340 --> 08:18.060
that gave me hope to think, you know, I could do that. I could. And it's surprising how
08:18.060 --> 08:25.060
little time it takes to, you know, accomplish that. Is that something, have other people
08:25.820 --> 08:31.820
been kind of referencing that too? Is that part of the, the, and maybe that's what's
08:31.820 --> 08:36.140
so good about having it as chapter two, because it gives you some hope, right?
08:36.140 --> 08:41.500
Well, what's interesting is that that process of changing in that way, it's happening anyway,
08:41.500 --> 08:44.580
you know, like, I mean, if you think back to like the beginning, like for example, if
08:44.580 --> 08:49.540
I think of my, the early days of my entrepreneurial career, well, I didn't have any entrepreneurs
08:49.540 --> 08:53.660
in my family. I didn't have any close friends who were entrepreneurs. There was no reason
08:53.660 --> 08:58.120
for me to think that's who I am or to feel like I was externally validated with like
08:58.280 --> 09:03.000
that was part of my identity. I had no evidence of it. And so early on, I just, all I had
09:03.000 --> 09:06.640
was hope, right? Like the hope that, oh, maybe I'll be able to build something. Maybe I'll
09:06.640 --> 09:11.720
be able to make this work. But then you start to show up. And for me, it was probably about
09:11.720 --> 09:16.200
two years in is probably about where the, where I kind of like the scale tipped. And
09:16.200 --> 09:20.980
I started to think I am an entrepreneur, like that's part of, of who I am, but it really
09:20.980 --> 09:27.600
took proving it to myself that I can pay my bills through this, you know, that I can like
09:27.720 --> 09:31.960
actually have a lifestyle and a career in this way. I had to prove it for about two
09:31.960 --> 09:39.720
years before I really started to latch onto it and say, this is who I am. And so my point
09:39.720 --> 09:44.600
is that's always happening. You're, you're always can, you're continually updating your
09:44.600 --> 09:49.360
beliefs about yourself based on the experiences that you're going through. And all I'm talking
09:49.360 --> 09:55.220
about is simply designing that process and a little more careful or thoughtful way rather
09:55.220 --> 09:58.860
than just kind of letting it happen to you and be like, well, I guess I'll figure out
09:58.860 --> 10:04.140
who I am based on what life throws at me versus how about I figure out who I am based on the
10:04.140 --> 10:08.500
votes that I cast each day and what I decide to, what habits I decide to follow. Yeah.
10:08.500 --> 10:13.800
Yeah. Again, like that is a very hopeful message for, for someone who's just kind of sitting
10:13.800 --> 10:21.980
back and waiting for it to happen. What, what sustains you when you're in the, in the process,
10:21.980 --> 10:27.700
but not there yet. Like, like you mentioned entrepreneur and you're like, man, it took
10:27.700 --> 10:33.780
a long time. Yeah. What's a really good question because I think a lot of habits, you know,
10:33.780 --> 10:39.660
entrepreneurship is certainly this way. Exercise is this way where the, the rewards of a habit
10:39.660 --> 10:45.540
are often very delayed. Uh, you know, like what's the reward for working out for like
10:45.540 --> 10:50.020
three weeks? Like not really a whole lot, honestly, your body hasn't really changed.
10:50.060 --> 10:54.740
The scale is probably about the same. Um, you're probably just sore, you know, like
10:54.740 --> 10:58.620
there, there probably isn't like a whole lot to show for it. Yeah. It's really not unless
10:58.620 --> 11:03.220
you stick with that habit for three months or six months or a year that you actually
11:03.220 --> 11:07.420
start to see the changes you were hoping to get when you set out. Yeah. And so there's
11:07.420 --> 11:13.120
kind of this like valley of death in the beginning where in a way it's sort of like gets harder
11:13.120 --> 11:17.900
before it gets easier. You know, it feels uncomfortable. You feel sore and pain, uh,
11:17.900 --> 11:22.100
you feel uncertain when you walk in the gym, you feel like people are judging you. Yeah.
11:22.100 --> 11:25.500
Same way with starting a business, you know, in a weird way, it's kind of harder before
11:25.500 --> 11:29.380
it gets easier. You start out, but you're not making any money. You feel stupid a lot
11:29.380 --> 11:33.360
of the time because you're, you don't know how to make a sales call or what customers
11:33.360 --> 11:38.140
are looking for or whether you're even offering the right product. Yeah. Um, I remember when
11:38.140 --> 11:42.820
I first started, I, uh, I, like I said, I didn't know anybody, didn't have any entrepreneurs
11:42.820 --> 11:46.140
in my family. So I was like, well, I need to get to know some people. Yeah. So I sent
11:46.180 --> 11:50.100
a bunch of emails to reach out and just ask if people would chat on Skype for like 30
11:50.100 --> 11:54.660
minutes or whatever. And I remember sending those first few and thinking, is this even,
11:54.660 --> 11:58.100
do people even do this? Do people chat on Skype with people that they haven't met before?
11:58.100 --> 12:01.860
Like, is this a weird thing to ask? You know, there's just a lot of that uncertainty early
12:01.860 --> 12:06.940
on. Yeah. So your point is I think a valid one, which is, well, what do you do to get
12:06.940 --> 12:10.500
through that? You know, like how do you, how do you kind of get through that valley of
12:10.500 --> 12:15.980
death while you're waiting for the long-term rewards to accumulate? Yeah. And I think that
12:15.980 --> 12:22.220
this is where, uh, psychologists call it reinforcement or an external reinforcer, but you, you want
12:22.220 --> 12:26.860
some kind of reinforcement that is enjoyable in the moment. So you have a reason to keep
12:26.860 --> 12:31.500
showing up. So there are, there are kind of from a habit standpoint, there are kind of
12:31.500 --> 12:37.220
two ways to do this. First thing is just a strategic choice about what type of habit
12:37.220 --> 12:42.520
you choose to follow. So if we go back to the exercise example, well, not everybody
12:42.560 --> 12:48.000
has to work out like a bodybuilder. You know, you could do Pilates or yoga or go for a run
12:48.000 --> 12:54.080
or rock climbing or, you know, all kinds of stuff. And so pick the form of a habit that
12:54.080 --> 12:59.440
brings you the most joy that is most enjoyable to you. It's going to be a slog for, you know,
12:59.440 --> 13:02.440
you're going to have to swim for months to see a change in your body. You're going to
13:02.440 --> 13:05.440
have to cycle for months. You're going to have to lift weights for months. It doesn't
13:05.440 --> 13:09.360
really matter which one you choose. It's going to take a while. So you might as well choose
13:09.360 --> 13:14.560
the one that's most exciting or enjoyable to you. Same way with like, you know, imagine
13:14.560 --> 13:18.080
a reading habit, you know, like you don't have to read. You might feel like, oh, I have
13:18.080 --> 13:22.720
a business so I need to read business books. But really ultimately the most important thing
13:22.720 --> 13:26.920
is do you get in the habit of reading? Do you fall in love with reading? So if you need
13:26.920 --> 13:32.320
to start with sci-fi books or fantasy or something like that, well, start with that, you know,
13:32.320 --> 13:37.680
like do the one that is intrinsically valuable to you at first. And once the habit is built,
13:37.680 --> 13:42.480
then you can transition to some of the other stuff. Yeah. So that's one method for for
13:42.480 --> 13:48.320
kind of getting through that valley of death. Yeah. And I think this brings up maybe a harder
13:48.320 --> 13:57.760
question, which is so, you know, based on your book, it's January and I'm thinking,
13:57.760 --> 14:02.540
okay, you know, I haven't been in the gym for seven years. I used to love working out.
14:02.540 --> 14:10.780
I'm going to go. I got my streaks app on my phone. Start going. And I've probably been,
14:10.780 --> 14:16.500
I don't know, I've probably been at least 18 days or maybe even 20 days this month.
14:16.500 --> 14:23.420
So it's great. And I was surprised by how fast I felt. So the first day I felt like
14:23.420 --> 14:28.300
I didn't belong. I felt awkward. I don't know anybody here. I'm walking in. Some of the
14:28.300 --> 14:34.940
machinery I recognize, some I don't. I have to like, you know, find, get back into a routine.
14:34.940 --> 14:40.380
I have to find which exercise I'm going to do. There's all these kind of insecurities
14:40.380 --> 14:49.020
and questions. But after a week, I kind of felt like I belonged. But I wonder if that's
14:49.020 --> 14:56.740
because it was easier for me. You know, I had this, you know, I'm I'm relatively I was
14:56.740 --> 15:03.220
already relatively in shape. So there's a big difference between going in where you feel like,
15:03.220 --> 15:08.460
oh, maybe I'm a few pounds overweight and going in and being 200 pounds overweight. There's a big
15:08.460 --> 15:16.300
difference between, you know, going in even as a white male compared to, you know, there's a big
15:16.300 --> 15:20.860
difference going in and feeling like, well, I've done these exercises before, so I'm not completely
15:20.860 --> 15:31.900
out of my element. And I'm wondering how I mean, are our habits like that achievable because of
15:31.900 --> 15:38.180
privilege and context and other things like how much does that play into it? And, you know, if
15:38.180 --> 15:44.540
someone is walking in and they're 200 pounds overweight, is, you know, do they still have the
15:44.540 --> 15:50.780
same chance of progress and success? It just feels like such a big mountain for them to go over.
15:51.340 --> 15:57.540
For sure. Yeah, they're. So this is one reason why I think starting with small habits is so
15:57.540 --> 16:02.700
incredibly important, because a lot of the time when we think about the outcome that you want. So
16:02.700 --> 16:07.700
just to continue your weight loss or exercise example. Yeah, everybody gets wrapped up in like,
16:07.700 --> 16:12.660
oh, I want to lose 100 pounds or I want to lose 20 pounds or whatever the number is. But you
16:12.660 --> 16:18.620
forget about there like all these little logistical and emotional details that come along with
16:18.780 --> 16:23.540
starting a new habit. So, you know, I'll often tell the story about I have this reader who he
16:23.540 --> 16:27.980
ended up losing over 100 pounds. And one of the first things he did was he went to the gym,
16:27.980 --> 16:33.020
but he wasn't allowed to stay for longer than five minutes. So he drove to the gym, got out of the
16:33.020 --> 16:38.540
car, did half an exercise, got back in the car, drove home. And it sounds ridiculous to people.
16:38.540 --> 16:43.060
It sounds silly because it's like, well, clearly exercising for five minutes is not going to get
16:43.060 --> 16:48.260
you in shape. Like, that's not. But what you realize is he was mastering the art of showing up.
16:48.740 --> 16:54.300
He was becoming the type of person that drove to the gym every day. And when you're in that state,
16:54.300 --> 16:59.500
right, for him at that point, that was the biggest shift was can I just become the type of person who
16:59.500 --> 17:05.060
gets in here, right? Who overcomes the uncertainty or feeling uncomfortable or feeling judged. And
17:05.060 --> 17:10.620
all those things are very real hurdles to building a habit. You know, like there's there are all these
17:10.620 --> 17:14.860
little questions that need to be answered for something like that. Like, okay, I want to go to
17:14.860 --> 17:19.900
the gym. Well, what time am I going to go? Am I going to go before work or after work? What gym
17:19.900 --> 17:25.260
will I go to? What route am I going to take to get there? Do I need to bring a water bottle or is
17:25.260 --> 17:30.620
there like a water fountain at the gym? And all those little questions like that, like, you know,
17:30.620 --> 17:36.100
whether or not you there's a water fountain at the gym, it sounds small. But if you already feel
17:36.100 --> 17:40.060
uncomfortable and feel like you don't belong, and then you always forget to bring your water bottle
17:40.060 --> 17:42.860
and you're like, oh, there's nothing ever and there's never anything to drink there. That's
17:42.860 --> 17:47.660
enough friction to get you to quit in the beginning. So starting with something simple,
17:47.660 --> 17:52.100
like all I'm going to do is I'm going to show up and I'm going to do one exercise for five minutes
17:52.100 --> 17:59.100
and I'm going to go. That I think is a good way to start. And it reminds me of what Steven Pressfield
17:59.100 --> 18:03.260
wrote, I think it was in the War of Art, where he said something to the effect of like, if you sit
18:03.260 --> 18:08.020
down each day at the computer, and you do your writing, at some point, at first, it feels
18:08.020 --> 18:13.300
uncomfortable. But at some point, that becomes your territory. And I really like that phrasing
18:13.300 --> 18:18.860
of it, because for an animal for a wolf or something, a plate a piece of land does not
18:18.860 --> 18:24.180
become their territory unless they spend time in it, right? Unless they are there each day,
18:24.180 --> 18:30.020
yeah, it has to become comfortable first. And so for many people building habits, whether that's
18:30.020 --> 18:33.980
getting into the gym or going to the yoga studio or sitting your butt in the chair and writing,
18:34.060 --> 18:39.980
you need to make that space your territory. And at the very first step is not getting a result.
18:39.980 --> 18:46.660
It's spending time there. It's making that little bit of land a zone where you feel like this is
18:46.660 --> 18:53.940
where I belong each day. And that's a big emotional hurdle to cross before you even worry about any
18:53.940 --> 18:58.340
of the physical or like actual technical things to do. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, the other thing
18:58.340 --> 19:06.660
that helped is I went with my wife. And it's funny because I felt like, you know, I'm like,
19:06.660 --> 19:13.540
Mr. Confident. But she was like, at one point, she's like, Justin, you are so nervous right now.
19:13.540 --> 19:18.820
Like she could tell how nervous I was. And I thought I was like keeping it all together. And
19:18.820 --> 19:25.380
it just reminded me of like, I'd been in gyms from the time I was in grade nine all the way
19:25.380 --> 19:32.260
through college. It wasn't like it was unfamiliar, but I was nervous because I was unfamiliar.
19:32.260 --> 19:38.420
There had been a seven year gap. And now I was like exploring this again, worried about what these
19:38.420 --> 19:43.780
people are thinking about me. Wow, that guy looks like he's way more fit than me. You know, like all
19:43.780 --> 19:52.260
these thoughts go through your head. And so, yeah, I think kind of figuring out how you can like make
19:52.260 --> 19:58.980
a step. And sometimes maybe it's like going with somebody. So you at least have some emotional
19:58.980 --> 20:04.500
because it's emotional. It's nice to have someone to kind of share the emotional burden, right?
20:04.500 --> 20:10.580
For sure. Well, if you come, the thing that ultimately what you're looking to do is,
20:10.580 --> 20:14.660
like we just said, feel like it's part of your territory. And because there are other people
20:14.660 --> 20:19.220
in that space, what that also means is you're looking to feel like you're part of the tribe
20:19.300 --> 20:23.220
who goes there, right? That you belong with the other people who are in that room.
20:23.940 --> 20:29.620
And so it helps to what is a tribe? Well, it's a group of people that you get along with,
20:29.620 --> 20:34.340
that you bond with, that you belong to over something else, over some shared interest.
20:34.900 --> 20:39.460
And in other words, it's a group in a lot of ways of friends, friends who share some kind of
20:39.460 --> 20:44.900
interest. So these are your gym friends. Well, if you go with your wife, then you automatically
20:44.900 --> 20:49.380
have at least one person in the tribe that you are friends with, that you do belong with.
20:50.260 --> 20:55.140
And so I think that helps you get over that hurdle a little bit. You're no longer facing
20:55.140 --> 21:01.060
that challenge alone. Before it was like, I am trying to get fit. Now it is we are trying
21:01.060 --> 21:07.940
to get fit. And that helps a lot with the kind of the mental feeling of like, do I belong or not?
21:07.940 --> 21:12.820
Yeah. I've also found, sorry, I don't mean to stay on this too long, but it's so fresh
21:13.780 --> 21:20.580
that the other thing I found myself doing, because I'm interested in the emotional friction behind
21:20.580 --> 21:27.860
habits. And so the other thing I was doing is I was going in there and I'm uncomfortable.
21:27.860 --> 21:33.460
So I'm trying to act really tough, but I'm not tough at all. I'm like, but I'm, you know,
21:33.460 --> 21:38.180
when people look at me, I'm kind of like scowling when like, I'm not being friendly. I'm not being
21:38.180 --> 21:47.060
myself. And I was thinking about that and thinking like, when you're kind of inward focused
21:47.940 --> 21:52.020
and you're in a new environment and you're trying to develop a new habit, but you're inward focused,
21:52.020 --> 21:57.700
it really is, it doesn't really help. And so I had to kind of turn that around and go, okay,
21:57.700 --> 22:02.660
I got to start being friendly. I got to start saying hi to these people, because if I wave at
22:02.660 --> 22:09.060
this person and it feels good, like they respond with a smile and that happens again next time.
22:09.060 --> 22:14.820
And again, next time, that's a little bit of a reward for me. That's going to keep me going to
22:14.820 --> 22:21.380
the gym. But if I keep going here with this like tough scowl on my face, you know, and it's hard
22:21.380 --> 22:29.620
because you feel like you don't belong, you feel nervous and you kind of default to these weird
22:29.700 --> 22:37.300
behaviors. And it took a little bit of time, but I realized, okay, now I got to get in the habit of
22:38.980 --> 22:44.740
smiling and saying hello when I'm in the gym, not just being like in my own zone and pretending I'm
22:45.620 --> 22:49.860
somebody I'm not. Right? Well, that's one thing that kind of helps you start to belong with or
22:49.860 --> 22:54.020
become part of the rest of the tribe. You know, like just a friendly behavior helps you start
22:54.020 --> 22:58.580
to develop friendships with some of those other people that are there. There was a study that I
22:58.580 --> 23:03.060
wanted to cite in Atomic Habits, but I couldn't find it to track it down, but I read about it
23:03.060 --> 23:10.500
years ago where the YMCA ran a survey. And when they surveyed people who were joining the gym,
23:10.500 --> 23:16.180
the thing that got them to join were the different classes offered, the equipment that was in the
23:16.180 --> 23:21.060
gym, basically facilities and features were the things that got people in for the first time.
23:21.060 --> 23:25.220
But then when they surveyed members who had been there for over a year, the thing that got people
23:25.220 --> 23:31.300
to stick, nobody mentioned features or facilities, everybody mentioned friendships. And so the people
23:31.300 --> 23:35.620
who actually stayed at the gym or kept their membership were the ones who ended up developing
23:35.620 --> 23:40.020
friendships with other people there. And I think you're right. Ultimately, the thing that gets you
23:40.020 --> 23:44.340
to come back is like, do I enjoy coming here? Does it mean I get to see some of my friends? Does it
23:44.340 --> 23:49.140
mean I get to hang out with people I like? Or, you know, it's really the sense of belonging that
23:49.140 --> 23:55.620
gets habits to stick. And the action itself is just kind of like something that's happening along
23:55.620 --> 24:01.060
the way. Yes. But there's a step before that that we kind of skipped over, which is like, how do you
24:01.060 --> 24:08.420
even choose a habit in the first place? Like, how does that happen in the sense of I might not know
24:08.420 --> 24:17.380
what's good for me? So how does that come into this? Yeah, well, there are a lot of ways to
24:17.380 --> 24:22.180
answer that question. So I'll just share a couple thoughts that come to mind. So the first thought
24:22.180 --> 24:26.340
that comes to mind is this question from I first heard from Seth Godin, which I think is just a
24:26.340 --> 24:31.700
great question, which is what is it for? And so this is a question that we need to ask ourselves
24:31.700 --> 24:35.780
when we're trying to build a new habit, which is what is this habit for? What is that? What am I
24:35.780 --> 24:40.980
actually trying to achieve here? Because the correct habit to choose is very different based
24:40.980 --> 24:45.860
on what your goals are, what you're hoping to get as an outcome, what kind of lifestyle you want.
24:47.460 --> 24:54.100
And, you know, so for example, the habit of making 20 sales calls a day. Well, if what it's for is to
24:54.100 --> 24:59.940
increase revenue, and to build a successful business, that's a wonderful thing. If you hate
24:59.940 --> 25:04.180
making sales calls, and you want to spend less time working and more time with your family,
25:04.180 --> 25:10.820
that could be a terrible habit to build. It just depends on what it's for. So that's one question
25:10.820 --> 25:18.100
to ask. But you are correct that we often don't know what we need in the moment. And I think part
25:18.100 --> 25:23.060
of that's just a challenge of life and a challenge of self awareness and you know, knowing what you
25:23.060 --> 25:29.300
need. But life is a very complex system. And so figuring out the right thing for that is sometimes
25:29.300 --> 25:36.900
it's just impossible or too many moving parts. So I tend to default to two possible answers.
25:36.980 --> 25:41.700
The first answer is we all need things that are so boring that we don't think about them,
25:41.700 --> 25:47.300
but are incredibly important for showing up each day. So did you sleep eight hours? Are you drinking
25:47.300 --> 25:51.300
enough water? Are you spending a little bit of time walking outside or getting a little bit of
25:51.300 --> 25:57.540
sunlight? Do you exercise consistently? Whatever form is interesting to you? Are you spending some
25:57.540 --> 26:02.420
time reading and soaking up new ideas? Now, I'm not saying you have to do all that stuff every day.
26:02.420 --> 26:07.060
But my point is like, those are things that most people would be like, yeah, of course,
26:07.060 --> 26:11.940
you should sleep and read more books and exercise. Everybody knows that's good. But your time is
26:11.940 --> 26:17.860
almost never going to be wasted by making sure you do one of those things. It's a fundamental
26:17.860 --> 26:22.420
that's worth spending time on, that's worth coming back to, that's worth reminding yourself of,
26:22.420 --> 26:28.340
even if you aren't sure the ideal perfect place to focus in your life. So that's the first answer.
26:28.340 --> 26:35.220
Come back to the fundamentals. The second answer is more broad. I can't be specific with it because
26:35.220 --> 26:41.860
it depends on each person. But the broad application is what I would call broad funnel tight filter.
26:41.860 --> 26:47.700
So whenever you're trying to figure out where to focus, you need a really broad range of research,
26:47.700 --> 26:54.020
try to get as many options as possible, then apply a really tight, strict filter to it,
26:54.020 --> 27:00.980
and just focus on the one or two best options that you found. So for example, I just finished
27:00.980 --> 27:05.140
Atomic Habits a few months ago. So now I'm thinking, should I write a second book? If I should,
27:05.140 --> 27:10.660
what should that be about? And I don't know right now. So I'm in the broad funnel stage. So I want
27:10.660 --> 27:15.300
to lay out as many options as possible. I want to brainstorm a thousand titles. I want to look at
27:15.300 --> 27:20.580
all the top books on Amazon. I want to browse my best performing tweets and see if there's a possible
27:20.580 --> 27:25.140
thread for a book idea in there. I want to look everywhere I can and just list all of that stuff
27:25.140 --> 27:30.820
in the same spreadsheet. And maybe I got 1200 ideas on there, really broad funnel. But then
27:31.380 --> 27:35.780
I need to apply a very tight filter. Is this something I'm interested in enough to spend
27:35.780 --> 27:40.980
two or three or four years working on? Is it a topic of broad appeal to a general audience?
27:40.980 --> 27:45.540
Are there going to be a lot of people that like this? Is this something that people,
27:45.540 --> 27:49.700
that I can actually turn into something actionable? You know, like can people use this in their daily
27:49.700 --> 27:55.220
life? Is this a topic that has a lot of stories that I could tell? Right? Can I actually make this
27:55.220 --> 27:59.460
entertaining or, you know, latch on to other interesting stories to make the book readable?
27:59.460 --> 28:03.540
Yes. So, you know, and those are just some of the filters, but they're, my point is that
28:04.100 --> 28:08.580
you want some period of very broad exploration. And then once you have a lot of options,
28:08.580 --> 28:13.540
you want to really tighten it down based on that question. What is this for? So in my case,
28:13.540 --> 28:18.500
the question I'm using is, well, it's for writing a good book, one that's highly actionable, one that
28:18.500 --> 28:24.020
sells a lot of copies, one that people find useful and so on. And so I think if you combine
28:24.020 --> 28:28.980
that broad funnel type filter strategy and that question of what is it for, that can maybe give
28:28.980 --> 28:32.820
you some more specific answers. But even if you don't come up with something good there,
28:32.820 --> 28:38.500
you can always focus on the fundamentals. Yeah. And the other thing, when you mentioned Seth Godin,
28:39.460 --> 28:46.420
he has this other line, which is people like us do things like this. I love that line. I wish I
28:46.420 --> 28:53.700
thought it up, but yeah, it's so good. It's such a great mantra. And what's interesting about it
28:54.500 --> 29:01.620
is, like for me, one thing that made me start thinking about healthy habits was
29:02.500 --> 29:10.740
hanging out with people who had healthy habits. And in some ways it was really lucky and fortunate.
29:11.540 --> 29:20.100
Like you guys invited me to that retreat you did. Yep. And in some ways I'm thankful you
29:20.100 --> 29:27.060
guys invited a loser like me, because I was hanging out in that group. I came and at first
29:27.060 --> 29:34.900
I was cynical and grumpy. And eventually, just looking around that group, I realized, man, these
29:34.980 --> 29:41.780
people like this do things like this. And my cynicism, which before would have been like,
29:41.780 --> 29:47.860
wow, people like that do stuff like that. It went down and then all of a sudden I was like, okay,
29:47.860 --> 29:56.580
well, if people like this do things like this, that's what I need to do. And I think for folks
29:56.580 --> 30:04.340
that are thinking like, okay, well, how do I know what good habits are? There are so many things
30:04.340 --> 30:12.180
that I would have never been, you know, what do you call it? There's like the stages of habits or
30:12.180 --> 30:17.380
whatever. But I would have never even had the cue if I had not first observed it and then noticed
30:17.380 --> 30:21.940
like, oh, wait, they're doing that, they're doing that, they're doing that. I'm the odd man out.
30:22.820 --> 30:29.460
And that's what motivated me to want to pursue some of that stuff. But if I hadn't been in that
30:29.460 --> 30:36.420
group and felt like, wait, wait a second, like, if I want to belong here, I've got to up my game,
30:36.420 --> 30:42.740
right? It would have never happened. And so people like us do things like this has been
30:42.740 --> 30:47.860
really helpful for me. Yeah, I love that phrase. And one of the reasons I said that, oh, I wish
30:47.860 --> 30:53.700
I had thought that up is because I think it applies so deeply to a lot of the ideas in atomic habits.
30:53.700 --> 31:00.820
It applies to how socially reinforced our habits are. I think this is, you know, I wrote about this
31:00.820 --> 31:05.780
in the book. I mean, I have a whole chapter on it. Chapter nine is all about that. But I think I
31:05.780 --> 31:12.100
still undersold the importance of how socially reinforced our habits are. And then it also
31:12.100 --> 31:18.100
references this, the importance of a shared identity. I think that ultimately a shared
31:18.100 --> 31:22.340
identity is really one of the most powerful forces for getting habits to stick. You know,
31:22.340 --> 31:28.580
like if you look at if you look at it in a big way, you can look at like religions, you know,
31:28.580 --> 31:33.940
people, religions are really interesting places to look for habits. People get in the habit of
31:33.940 --> 31:41.220
going to church every Sunday for 50 years, largely because it's reinforced. The other people in their
31:41.220 --> 31:47.540
neighborhoods go, the people on their block go, they see their friends there. They it's a very
31:47.620 --> 31:53.860
socially reinforced habit. Same thing is true in smaller ways. Like let's say you move into a new
31:53.860 --> 31:58.900
house and you walk outside on Tuesday night and you see all your neighbors have their recycling
31:58.900 --> 32:03.860
bins out. And you're like, huh, people like us do things like this. Like people who live in this
32:03.860 --> 32:09.380
neighborhood recycle on Tuesday nights. I guess we need to sign up for recycling. And there are
32:09.380 --> 32:15.220
really almost an infinite range of examples that are like that, both large and small, where our
32:15.220 --> 32:20.180
habits are we notice them because the people around us are doing them, which is what the Q
32:20.180 --> 32:26.260
portion is you referenced. We desire to do them. We crave to follow through on them because by
32:26.260 --> 32:31.860
doing the same, we fit in or signal to the other people around us. Hey, I get it. I'm part of the
32:31.860 --> 32:38.340
tribe too. It becomes easier to do it because sometimes you have friends helping you out.
32:38.340 --> 32:43.140
You know, like it's like having a spotter at the gym, like, oh, people like us to help each other
32:43.140 --> 32:49.540
out when a set is hard. And then ultimately it becomes satisfying because you enjoy being
32:49.540 --> 32:53.700
praised for it. You know, other people are like, Hey, it was great to see you at church on Sunday
32:53.700 --> 33:00.980
or no really good job on that workout today. And that feels good to be praised for fitting in.
33:00.980 --> 33:10.180
And so in that way, socially reinforced habits or the collective identity, it hits all four stages
33:10.180 --> 33:17.620
of habit formation. And I knew that when I was writing it, but I don't think I gave it as much
33:17.620 --> 33:21.540
importance as I should have. It's a very powerful driver of behavior in the long run.
33:21.540 --> 33:33.700
Yeah, totally. And I think this is why cynicism is such a toxic attitude. And, you know, I guess
33:33.700 --> 33:40.820
I'm in gen X. I'm born in 1980. There's a lot of cynicism in gen X and then millennials also have
33:40.820 --> 33:47.060
a little bit of this too. And I think, and actually to be honest, everybody has a baby boomers have it
33:47.060 --> 33:52.980
when, you know, if you're a 50 year old programmer and you're, you get hired at a startup where the
33:52.980 --> 34:02.660
CEO is 20 years old, then we kind of default to cynicism. And it, it, it's such a blocker when
34:02.660 --> 34:07.460
you're like trying to observe those norms, like, oh wait, like people like us do things like this.
34:08.100 --> 34:13.620
Cynicism allows you to go, well, yeah, people like that do stuff like that. That's good for them.
34:13.620 --> 34:22.500
That's good for James Clear, but you know, that's not good for me. And when I'm trying to kind of
34:22.500 --> 34:28.980
reveal from my experience for anyone that ever watches this or listens to this is that you really
34:28.980 --> 34:37.460
do need to step outside that and at least be open to this idea that your life could get better.
34:37.460 --> 34:44.100
And it could just be going, okay, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna vote for who I'm going to be today. And
34:44.100 --> 34:49.060
I'm going to vote for who I'm going to be tomorrow. And I'm going to keep going. The other thing in
34:49.060 --> 34:52.740
the book that really helped me and I'm probably going to butcher it. So you clean up after I do
34:52.740 --> 34:59.380
it, but you show this grid. So imagine like on this side of your day, it's like, okay, I make a
34:59.380 --> 35:04.100
good decision. So it goes up and then I make another good decision, goes up, but then I make
35:04.100 --> 35:10.820
a bad decision. Like I eat a tub of ice cream and you know, sometimes eating the tub of ice cream is
35:10.820 --> 35:19.380
like debilitating. It's like, well, I'm done. I ate the tub ice cream. I suck at this. I'm just
35:19.380 --> 35:24.660
going to go get into bed and forget about it. And in your grid, you show, wait, but you're still up
35:24.660 --> 35:31.220
here. Like you can just make another good decision and then you're back up again. And I like that idea
35:31.220 --> 35:36.740
of kind of navigating your ideas, not being so hard on ourselves. Did I kind of get that right?
35:37.780 --> 35:41.700
Yeah. I, so this is the, I don't know if you can see it, but this is the image.
35:42.740 --> 35:49.140
But it's, it's a, it's this idea that like the difference between a good day and a bad day is
35:49.140 --> 35:54.100
often just a series of choices, right? And you can win each little moment, right? You can win
35:54.100 --> 35:58.420
each decisive moment just because you ate the tub of ice cream. Doesn't mean you can't win the next
35:58.420 --> 36:05.940
moment. And, and so one thing that I was thinking about when I wrote that is this concept that I
36:05.940 --> 36:11.620
call decisive moments. This idea that there are a few choices each day, maybe somewhere between say
36:11.620 --> 36:17.540
five and 10 that kind of determine the next chunk of time. And so, so for example, there's a moment
36:17.540 --> 36:23.940
for me each morning where I sit down and either I open up Evernote and I start writing the next
36:23.940 --> 36:31.220
article I'm going to work on, or I go to ESPN and I check the latest sports news. And what happens
36:31.220 --> 36:36.260
in the next hour is really determined by what happens in like the first 45 seconds. You know,
36:36.260 --> 36:42.980
like do I, do I go to Evernote or do I go to ESPN? And so that is a decisive moment in my language.
36:42.980 --> 36:47.700
That's like a moment that determines if I can master those 45 seconds, then I can end up
36:47.700 --> 36:52.980
mastering the next hour that comes afterward almost automatically. Same thing is true. There's
36:52.980 --> 36:58.740
a moment each night, like 5.15 or so my wife gets home from work and either we change into our workout
36:58.740 --> 37:04.580
clothes or we like sit on the couch and watch reruns the office and order Indian food or whatever.
37:04.580 --> 37:10.260
And both of those nights are good nights, but the moment to master is do we change into our
37:10.260 --> 37:14.820
workout clothes or not? If we do that, it only takes a few minutes. Everything else for the next
37:14.820 --> 37:18.820
two hours is already decided. We'll get in the car, we'll drive to the gym, we'll do the reps.
37:18.820 --> 37:24.260
Like it's all, it's all pretty much done at that point. So the reason I like bringing that up or
37:24.260 --> 37:30.820
like thinking about that is you start to realize there really isn't that much that you need to
37:30.820 --> 37:36.740
master. Really, you just are trying to focus your attention on a few key decisive moments
37:36.740 --> 37:41.860
throughout the day. It's kind of like applying judo to your life. It's like apply the pressure
37:41.860 --> 37:46.260
and the leverage at just the right point and then the next hour kind of falls into place automatically.
37:47.540 --> 37:52.180
And so I like that because once you realize that, once you kind of identify those high leverage
37:52.180 --> 37:59.860
decision points, you can organize your day and your environment around those things. If I know
38:00.500 --> 38:06.420
that those 45 seconds where I'm choosing between Evernote or ESPN is a real key moment, well,
38:06.420 --> 38:13.300
I could install Freedom and then I could block ESPN from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and that takes care
38:13.300 --> 38:17.060
of that decisive moment and it increases the odds that I'm going to open Evernote instead.
38:18.180 --> 38:23.060
But anyway, so little choices like that are easier to make once you've identified some of
38:23.060 --> 38:27.220
those key points of leverage. Yeah, and you talk in the book, like there's some tricks too
38:27.860 --> 38:36.980
where you can make things automatic. Like you talk about Neera Yal buying a little device that just
38:36.980 --> 38:42.500
shuts off his internet every night at 10. Yeah, outlet timer. Yeah, and what's brilliant about
38:42.500 --> 38:47.540
that is like it shuts it off, especially if it's in the basement or whatever. You're not going to
38:47.540 --> 38:54.020
go downstairs and fiddle around with it. And then it's just, that's what happens, right?
38:54.980 --> 39:00.740
If you like, if ESPN was really killing you, you could just cancel your cable subscription.
39:00.740 --> 39:05.940
That might be a bit, but then you would, you go to watch ESPN, you can't, right? It's done.
39:07.860 --> 39:12.020
By the way, you mentioned this in the book too, but it's so funny how certain people's,
39:12.900 --> 39:18.100
what is a trigger for some people is not for others. Like ESPN for me is not a,
39:19.060 --> 39:22.660
that's not a temptation at all. Yeah, it doesn't even enter your worldview.
39:22.660 --> 39:28.180
Doesn't enter my worldview, but it shows you how identity is so much a part of this. Like if I was
39:28.180 --> 39:34.260
hanging out with a bunch of Oilers fans every single day, and this happened in the cowork office,
39:34.260 --> 39:39.940
you know, there's a few people and they're watching Oilers games, you know, on their computers.
39:40.580 --> 39:45.220
And I realized like, if I want to talk to them, I've got to start watching Oilers games.
39:45.220 --> 39:49.460
So people like us do things like this. And so I started developing this habit of watching
39:49.460 --> 39:54.980
Oilers games when before I didn't even care. I think, I mean, I think this is one of the reasons
39:54.980 --> 40:00.100
why sports is so tribal. Why people get so emotional about it is that it becomes a
40:00.100 --> 40:04.900
connection point for the relationships. It's not even the, the game is actually,
40:04.900 --> 40:08.580
no one would ever say that because everybody acts like the game is the thing that matters the most.
40:08.580 --> 40:13.620
But in a weird way, it's kind of a secondary thing, you know, really like when I think back for me,
40:14.500 --> 40:19.220
sports is a way for my brother and I to connect and for us to have something to text about and
40:19.220 --> 40:23.300
chat about throughout the week. It's a thing that, you know, it's a reason for my dad and I
40:23.300 --> 40:28.260
to get together in person and to go to games and hang out. And like it's, it's all the other stuff
40:28.260 --> 40:34.740
that it provides that makes it so deeply meaningful. And then you, you know, you end up assigning a lot
40:34.740 --> 40:39.220
of that emotion to how the team does on the field as well with the scores on the scoreboard. But,
40:40.420 --> 40:45.140
yeah, you're, it's a good example there. On that topic then, and this is Corey Stone is asking this
40:45.140 --> 40:50.100
in chat, but there's a lot of people on Twitter that asked this too. Given that example that you
40:50.100 --> 40:57.700
just gave, if your meaningful relationships are engaging in habits that might not be good for you
40:57.700 --> 41:04.340
or that you want to change, how do you navigate that? So if you're really feeling like I gotta,
41:04.900 --> 41:10.020
I gotta stop watching sports, it's just like I get a little bit and then I just go crazy,
41:10.820 --> 41:15.860
but I still want to have a relationship with my brother. This is where it gets complex,
41:15.860 --> 41:21.620
especially if you're married to somebody. Like if your wife is, is like, your wife is at least
41:21.620 --> 41:26.900
somewhat inclined to want to go to the gym, I'm guessing. But if she was like, no, I just want
41:26.900 --> 41:32.180
to watch Netflix and order Indian food. That's all I want to do. How do you start to navigate those
41:32.180 --> 41:39.140
things? Yeah, those are good questions. I mean, it's really hard because especially if it's a
41:39.140 --> 41:43.780
person who you want to stay in your life, you know, I think first of all, I just want to say,
41:43.780 --> 41:49.940
so I have some things I want to add to this, but I feel like it's worth noting that this question
41:49.940 --> 41:56.580
comes up a lot. And I think the reason it comes up a lot is because we all know that actually there
41:56.580 --> 42:00.820
isn't a good easy answer. And that it's like just a hard part of life. You know what I mean? Like
42:00.820 --> 42:05.540
everybody wants, it's one of those things we want to keep asking about in hopes that, oh, maybe
42:05.540 --> 42:09.700
there'll be an easy way to resolve this. But I think we all know like it's a challenge.
42:11.220 --> 42:16.500
Now that said, there are a few things you can do. So first thing is sometimes your friends and
42:16.500 --> 42:21.700
family want to do something different than how you want to change. So like you're, you want to
42:21.700 --> 42:28.020
stick to a new diet. They want to eat the old way or something like that. Well, you want to start
42:28.020 --> 42:32.500
doing yoga. They couldn't care less about yoga. They don't want to go to class with you, things
42:32.500 --> 42:38.580
like that. Well, if that's the case, then for certain habits, you don't have to like fire your
42:38.580 --> 42:43.940
friends and family to be able to do that. But what you can't, what you do need or what can be really
42:43.940 --> 42:50.180
useful is having like a sacred space where that occurs, where I'm not saying you need to do this
42:50.180 --> 42:54.980
with me, but just don't make it harder on me, right? Just don't conflict with. So, you know,
42:54.980 --> 43:00.660
the yoga example is an easier one where it's like, well, maybe you need to go to a yoga studio away
43:00.660 --> 43:05.700
from the friends and family that aren't interested and start to build friendships with people who
43:05.700 --> 43:09.460
are, you know, I'm not saying you need to get rid of your old friends, but maybe it'd be helpful to
43:09.460 --> 43:13.780
build a couple of new ones who are into yoga so that you have like a safe space for that habit
43:13.780 --> 43:20.660
to live. So that's one thing. Then there's the second piece, which is sometimes you're building
43:20.660 --> 43:26.340
a habit that you do want the person to like join you on, to come along with you. You know, you're
43:26.340 --> 43:30.580
working out and you would love for your spouse to join you at the gym or something like that.
43:31.140 --> 43:36.980
And everybody knows, like it would be good, but they feel, maybe they feel less comfortable there
43:36.980 --> 43:42.660
than you do, or maybe they feel, you know, you were previously an athlete and they were not.
43:42.660 --> 43:46.980
And so you feel kind of comfortable in the gym. You've been there before in years past, but for
43:46.980 --> 43:50.500
them, it's like new and weird. And, you know, they feel like they're being judged and whatever.
43:50.500 --> 43:56.260
Mm-hmm. If you're dealing with a case like that, the thing that I try to keep in mind,
43:56.260 --> 44:01.540
and I can tell you from working with my own family, it can be incredibly useful is praise
44:01.540 --> 44:08.100
the good, ignore the bad. It's very hard to do. It's very, the difficult part about it is not doing
44:08.100 --> 44:13.620
it on an individual basis. It's that this needs to be the new lifestyle for you. So when they do the
44:13.620 --> 44:18.900
thing that you're asking them to do, don't, basically another way to phrase this is don't
44:18.900 --> 44:23.860
criticize people for doing what you were hoping they would, you know? Like there are so many times
44:23.860 --> 44:28.740
when the introverted kid in the family will come down to the dinner table and it's like, oh, look
44:28.740 --> 44:34.180
who decided to join us. And it's like, well, they finally did the thing that you were hoping they
44:34.180 --> 44:39.060
would do and engage with everybody. And now they just feel like they're getting criticized for it.
44:39.060 --> 44:46.340
Or you go to the gym and your spouse decides to join you and they do a few sets and then they
44:46.340 --> 44:51.460
feel like they're done. And you say, well, that was a pretty short workout. And what you should
44:51.460 --> 44:56.020
be saying is, I think it's great that you got in here tonight, right? Like you weren't feeling it,
44:56.020 --> 45:02.660
but you were still able to make it in. And so praise the good, ignore the bad. And if you can
45:02.660 --> 45:09.700
do that in the long run, what ends up happening is everybody likes feeling praised. Everybody likes
45:09.700 --> 45:15.940
feeling rewarded. They like to, it feels satisfying to do something that the people who love you and
45:15.940 --> 45:21.460
who are around you praise you for. And so at first you go to the gym and they say, hey, I'm really
45:21.460 --> 45:25.940
proud of you for getting in here tonight. Good job. And it doesn't seem like much, but then after two
45:25.940 --> 45:31.460
months and three months and 10 months of that, you turn around a year later and they might never even
45:31.460 --> 45:36.900
say it, but implicitly what they've realized is damn, every time I go to the gym, it feels good.
45:36.900 --> 45:42.340
They like, they compliment me. And that, so now all of a sudden you start to associate going to the gym
45:42.340 --> 45:48.180
with feeling good. And this is a really long game play because it takes a while for that to
45:48.180 --> 45:55.140
reinforce itself. But, you know, same thing like the introverted kid at the table sits down and
45:55.140 --> 45:58.500
they say something that happened today and it's like, oh, that's awesome. Thanks for sharing that
45:58.500 --> 46:03.380
with us. You know, I'm like on that individual night, that one night at dinner doesn't count for
46:03.380 --> 46:09.300
a lot, but if every time they speak up, they're rewarded for it, then all of a sudden now they
46:09.300 --> 46:14.260
have a reason to start doing that more in the months and years to come. So it takes a while,
46:14.260 --> 46:18.660
but I think that that's like an effective way to gradually nudge people in the right direction.
46:18.660 --> 46:22.340
Yeah. There's someone in the chat that's saying they need to apply that idea to
46:22.340 --> 46:28.260
themselves to avoid feeling guilty for not doing enough. So instead of reinforce, oh, you idiot,
46:28.260 --> 46:34.100
you didn't go to the gym again, you fatty. You know, like that's not helpful. There's the
46:34.100 --> 46:40.340
self-talk. It can work with self-talk as well. This is why I think small habits can be so useful
46:40.340 --> 46:45.060
in some ways, even on the bad days, because like, let's say you're in that situation you just said
46:45.060 --> 46:50.660
where it's like, oh, you know, skip the gym again. Well, you can still do one push-up or one air
46:50.660 --> 46:55.700
squat or whatever before you go do a set of 10 air squats before you hop in bed tonight. And
46:56.500 --> 47:01.300
it's not going to transform your body, but that's not really the point. The point is to prove to
47:01.300 --> 47:06.580
yourself that it wasn't a good day. I didn't have the best motivation or energy. I had a long day
47:06.580 --> 47:12.420
at work, but I still am not the type of person who misses workouts, right? I still prove to myself,
47:12.420 --> 47:17.860
I still cast a vote for being that kind of person. I didn't let a day go by without doing nothing.
47:17.860 --> 47:24.660
And that can count for a lot in the long run. And so sometimes small habits are less about
47:24.660 --> 47:28.260
the outcome they deliver and more about the identity they reinforce.
47:28.260 --> 47:35.220
Yeah. And I've actually found, you know, another thing I tried to, I'm implementing
47:35.780 --> 47:42.660
in the new year is I decided to quit drinking alcohol. And right now it's ostensibly for this
47:42.660 --> 47:48.660
goal of hitting a revenue mark. Once I hit the goal, then I can have a drink. But the deeper
47:48.660 --> 47:54.980
motivation for me was I just realized like, it just makes it a depressant. It's like, there's a
47:54.980 --> 48:02.580
bunch of reasons that it's not good for me. And so my excuse or my way of trying it out is saying,
48:02.580 --> 48:07.460
well, I'm going for this goal, but it's been interesting in social situations because all
48:07.460 --> 48:14.740
my friends still drink and that's fine with me. But sometimes just sharing the goal, oh,
48:14.740 --> 48:19.860
I'm just doing this because I'm going after this thing. And you talk about how goals are sometimes
48:19.860 --> 48:26.020
helpful in setting your direction. You know, like, okay, I'm pointed this way now. And
48:26.980 --> 48:31.060
sometimes sharing that with people is helpful. The other thing is I think eventually, if I just
48:31.060 --> 48:38.580
keep doing this, just for me to say, well, I'm a non-drinker now. Yeah. And so I can still go and
48:38.580 --> 48:46.260
have my favorite. And it's also nice having a thing that you like. So my favorite non-alcoholic drink
48:46.260 --> 48:53.940
is a non-alcoholic Caesar. It's like a Bloody Mary. And to have that drink, it's like kind of spicy.
48:54.660 --> 49:00.340
There's a reward there. I also have this social crutch that I can use in the situation,
49:00.340 --> 49:06.500
you know, and if somebody asks me about it, I also have this new identity, which is, oh,
49:06.500 --> 49:11.700
I'm a non-drinker now. I just don't drink. And you talked about that. There's some research behind
49:11.700 --> 49:16.420
that. I know you've mentioned it a lot, but it's like, I'm trying to quit smoking versus I'm a
49:16.420 --> 49:23.940
non-smoker. Right? Is that correct? Correct. Yeah. So I think that that can be really helpful.
49:28.740 --> 49:31.700
I think what you're explaining here, the situation that you're going through,
49:31.700 --> 49:36.500
this experience you're having is kind of it's illustrating this process of identity change,
49:36.500 --> 49:40.260
right? It started with, oh, I'm just going to put it off for a little while while I'm attacking this
49:40.260 --> 49:44.740
goal. But then you're casting so many votes for like, you know what? I haven't drank and like,
49:44.740 --> 49:48.740
I'm kind of benefiting from it. Like maybe this is part of my identity now. Maybe I'm a non-drinker.
49:50.740 --> 49:54.180
So anyway, yeah, I think you're definitely on the right track there. Yeah. And actually,
49:54.180 --> 50:02.100
this is a good time to bring up two Twitter questions. Maria Aldry asks, you know, how do
50:02.100 --> 50:07.540
you maintain habits? Ask him about maintaining habits for people with depression, anxiety,
50:07.540 --> 50:15.460
or attention deficit. Do you want to try to tackle that? Yeah. So I've tried to be careful
50:15.460 --> 50:20.420
about saying that atomic habits is about building habits and breaking bad habits, building good ones.
50:20.980 --> 50:25.540
But it's not a book on addiction. It's not a book on depression. It's not a book about anxiety or
50:25.540 --> 50:33.220
ADHD or any of these other disorders or ailments. And I don't consider myself an expert on addiction.
50:34.100 --> 50:39.540
However, something interesting has happened. So I published the book and I have had a ton of
50:39.540 --> 50:43.540
speaking requests recently. And so I've been doing speeches at conferences and companies and
50:43.540 --> 50:49.700
different events and whatever. And so many times I get someone that comes up to me afterward or
50:49.700 --> 50:56.260
that asks a question during Q&A that talks about how useful the book was for their son who had ADHD
50:56.260 --> 51:01.300
or their cousin was a meth addict and then was able to like start to, you know, write the ship
51:01.300 --> 51:06.020
by employing some of these techniques or whatever. Yeah. Which is great, which is very gratifying.
51:06.020 --> 51:10.740
I still stand by my original statement. I'm not an expert on addiction. I don't want to like take
51:10.740 --> 51:16.260
a strong stance with this stuff. But what I've realized is that the principles that I lay out
51:16.260 --> 51:22.260
in atomic habits are really about how human behavior works. It's about how habits are formed
51:22.260 --> 51:28.580
and whether that habit is something extreme like an addiction or picking your skin or OCD or ADHD
51:28.580 --> 51:33.940
or whatever. Or whether it's something more moderate like meditating for three minutes a day.
51:34.980 --> 51:40.820
The fundamentals tend to be similar. And so I'm not going to say that the book offers a prescription
51:40.820 --> 51:46.500
for overcoming addictions. But what I will say is you'd be hard pressed to find tactics in the book
51:46.500 --> 51:50.500
that wouldn't at least help, right? That wouldn't at least nudge people in the right direction.
51:52.180 --> 51:58.340
I have heard from a few readers who specifically have said that they had ADHD and that they found
51:58.340 --> 52:03.540
the book very helpful. Environment design for whatever reason has been something that's come
52:03.540 --> 52:08.980
up multiple times for folks who have struggled with that. So I think it's kind of like if you're
52:08.980 --> 52:14.740
the type of person who is less likely to just remember to do it, right? Or just follow your
52:14.740 --> 52:21.220
to-do list. If that's not you, then structuring an environment where it's easier to see the cues of
52:21.220 --> 52:27.460
your good habits, less likely to see the distractions, less friction between you and the good behavior,
52:27.460 --> 52:32.740
more friction between you and the bad ones. If you place yourself in that space, it's much more
52:32.740 --> 52:37.940
likely that you're going to fall through. So those are things that I talk about in chapters 6 and 12.
52:37.940 --> 52:43.780
But I think that the book applies. But I don't pitch it as like a prescription for someone
52:43.780 --> 52:48.660
dealing with a more serious issue. Totally. Yeah. And I would say, again, I'm not an expert
52:48.660 --> 52:53.700
either, but as someone who has been dealing with depression the past couple of years,
52:57.460 --> 53:01.860
having a professional that you go to that deals with this stuff all the time like a therapist
53:01.860 --> 53:09.940
is so helpful. And the therapist will be very interested if you read James's book.
53:09.940 --> 53:15.460
So I said to my therapist, I'm like, you know, she starts way back here. And then she says,
53:15.460 --> 53:18.900
so what's new with you? I'm like, well, you know, I read this book and I'm thinking, oh,
53:18.900 --> 53:24.180
what are you thinking about doing with that? Oh, I'm thinking about maybe quitting alcohol. Oh,
53:24.180 --> 53:28.020
well, that's, you know, there's some reinforcement from the professionals.
53:29.140 --> 53:35.940
And likewise with my doctor, you know, when I had depression and I went to my physician,
53:36.820 --> 53:46.020
she said, she gave me two prescriptions, quit drinking alcohol and quit taking any kind of
53:46.020 --> 53:53.460
cannabis. And the reason is she says those are going to make you feel bad. Now the trigger in
53:53.460 --> 53:57.300
that case was my doctor. It's nice when you have a doctor saying, listen, this is your prescription.
53:57.300 --> 54:04.500
Oh, and double the amount of exercise I was doing. So three things. Those, so I did that for three
54:04.500 --> 54:09.780
months and then, you know, I went back to my old habits, but now I have that memory of what it was
54:09.780 --> 54:15.380
like for three months. And it's been a powerful trigger for me to, you know, when I am starting
54:15.380 --> 54:21.380
to notice my mood go down, I can, I remembered, you know, my doctor's prescription was quit
54:21.460 --> 54:28.100
drinking, quit, you know, eating edibles and doubling my exercise. And that's been helpful
54:28.100 --> 54:33.140
for me personally. So I think if you're reading the book, let your professional in your life know
54:33.140 --> 54:40.900
about it is good. And one thing I want you to do is, cause I love the imagery, but, and this is
54:40.900 --> 54:45.780
probably unfair to you, is to give the ice cube example, but use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.
54:46.420 --> 54:56.820
So this is an example from the first chapter of the book. And I actually, as a side note,
54:56.820 --> 54:59.860
I thought about this. I was like, man, we're going to have to get these change for the foreign
54:59.860 --> 55:04.260
additions. Like we're going to, it's going to need to be, but anyway, so yeah, yeah. The,
55:06.180 --> 55:10.740
the core idea is that the process of changing your habits is, well, it's similar to what we
55:10.740 --> 55:15.380
talked about early on, that there's often this valley of death, that there's this period where
55:15.380 --> 55:19.780
you're just kind of building up latent potential, but you're not really releasing any other results
55:19.780 --> 55:25.460
yet. And I like to equate it to the process of heating up an ice cube, you know? So you've got,
55:25.460 --> 55:29.780
you've got this ice cube sitting on the table, right? And so let's say it's like negative three
55:29.780 --> 55:35.300
degrees in there, right? So you're, you're a negative three, it's cold. You can see your breath.
55:35.300 --> 55:40.580
The ice cube sitting there, you heat it up negative two, negative one. Still there's this ice cube
55:40.580 --> 55:46.100
sitting there. Nothing has happened. Right. Then you go from negative one to zero. And all of a
55:46.100 --> 55:51.700
sudden you have this one degree shift, no different than any of the other shifts that came before it,
55:51.700 --> 55:58.340
but you have this phase transition, right? And like the ice cube starts melting. And that I think is
55:58.340 --> 56:03.220
indicative of what it often feels like to change a habit. You're making these little improvements.
56:03.220 --> 56:09.300
You're trying to make these 1% changes, these one degree shifts each day. And you're like,
56:09.300 --> 56:13.940
it's really easy to get frustrated or even depressed at that point. You know, it's like,
56:13.940 --> 56:17.460
I've been running for three weeks. How come I can't see a change in my body? You know,
56:17.460 --> 56:21.620
or I've been writing blog posts for six months now. How come this site isn't popular yet?
56:22.180 --> 56:27.140
And the key point there is your work was not being wasted. It's just being stored.
56:27.140 --> 56:32.580
Yeah. Complaining about sticking to a habit for two months or three months or even six months
56:32.580 --> 56:37.140
or a year and not having the outcome that you want is kind of like complaining about heating an
56:37.140 --> 56:41.220
ice cube from negative three to negative one degrees and it not melting yet. You know, like
56:41.860 --> 56:47.620
the work was not wasted. It's just being stored. And I love that quote that's in that same section
56:47.620 --> 56:53.940
from Jacob Reese who it hangs in the locker room with the San Antonio, who won five NBA championships.
56:53.940 --> 57:00.900
And it says essentially, when I feel like giving up, I think about the stone cutter who continues
57:00.900 --> 57:05.860
to hammer away at the stone a hundred times without it splitting. And then finally on the
57:05.860 --> 57:10.820
hundred and first blow, it cracks in two. And I know that it wasn't the hundred that can't there.
57:10.820 --> 57:14.020
I know it wasn't the hundred and first swing that did it, but the hundred that came before.
57:14.900 --> 57:21.140
And like it's that same idea. You know, the reason the site takes off is not because of the one viral
57:21.140 --> 57:27.060
article. It's because of the 55 that you wrote in the weeks and months prior. The reason that you see
57:27.060 --> 57:31.780
a change in your body is not because today's workout radically transform you. It's because
57:31.780 --> 57:38.100
you've been sticking to it for eight months now. And it's really about showing up, continue to put
57:38.100 --> 57:43.620
those swings in, continue to raise the temperature by one degree. And eventually you hit that phase
57:43.620 --> 57:50.660
transition where you can see the results of your work. Yeah. And that image has been so powerful
57:50.660 --> 57:58.580
in my life. I've been telling people about this book and I actually notice there's kind of like a
57:58.580 --> 58:03.860
coffee shop test. Like if I hear people talking about something from internet culture in a coffee
58:03.860 --> 58:12.820
shop, like real people, then something's hit and atomic habits is like that. Like it hit the kind
58:12.820 --> 58:22.580
of mainstream and that image of just raising the temperature a little bit every day. Now I feel like
58:22.900 --> 58:32.900
I'm a few months into this and I'm a little bit kind of like evangelical about it. Like I'm saying,
58:32.900 --> 58:40.100
now I'm like, God, like my life is so much better. And it's because of just these little changes over
58:40.100 --> 58:47.940
time in the same direction. I can now I can see it. Now I can see that I feel better. You know, wow,
58:47.940 --> 58:52.340
man, quitting alcohol, that was one thing. And then wow, showing up at the gym three or four times a
58:52.340 --> 58:56.580
week, that really helps. And wow, like reading a real book every night before I go to bed,
58:56.580 --> 59:03.460
all of these things keep kind of adding up and do make a meaningful difference in your life.
59:03.460 --> 59:07.220
Even though way back when, when you're starting, you feel like, well, nothing's going to help
59:08.260 --> 59:16.100
me now. I want to be clear that these ideas have meaningfully impacted my life.
59:16.740 --> 59:21.060
So I'm yeah, I'm really thankful. I'm thankful you wrote that book. I'm thankful you
59:22.420 --> 59:24.660
talked to me in the airport. It's been really great for me.
59:25.540 --> 59:29.700
That's awesome. Thank you so much for sharing that. And ultimately that's what the whole thing
59:29.700 --> 59:34.180
is for, right? I mean, it just, it makes it feel like it was worth the effort to spend a few years
59:34.180 --> 59:39.940
writing it and working on it. So that's great. So before you go, some people are asking like
59:39.940 --> 59:45.620
what recommendations for system services, tools, trackers, I know you have a new one coming out.
59:45.620 --> 59:49.860
Do you want to talk about that? Sure. Yeah. So I got it right here next to me, actually. So this
59:49.860 --> 59:57.300
is a habit journal and we, we just launched it two weeks ago and it's got, it's basically a
59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.740
doc grid notebook. So if you're into bullet journaling or you're into keeping a notebook
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:05.380
or use a notebook, the vast majority of it are doc grid pages. So you'll be able to use it like
01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:10.900
any normal one. But then at the back, there's a section with a habit tracker templates. And
01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.420
I don't know if you can see that very well, but I've been using it. For example, this is this
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:21.060
month. So you can see me tracking my habits on here. And so anyway, those templates are in the
01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:24.820
back and they're also perforated. So you can tear them out and put them on your desk or put them on
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:29.780
your kitchen counter or your refrigerator or whatever. And then, and then at the very beginning
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:36.180
of the book, there is a section called one line per day. So I've been using it for what happened
01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:42.420
today. And so I've been writing down what happened each day and there are 31 lines. So one for each
01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:46.740
day of the month and there are 12 of them. So by the time you get to the end of the year,
01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:51.140
you should be able to flip through and see, you know, if you I'm doing what happened today,
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:56.660
Sean Blank does, what's the highlight of the day? Some other ones that I've seen are, you know,
01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:00.500
what am I grateful for? Or you could use it as like a productivity thing. You could say like,
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:05.620
what's my most important task today, things like that. So there are a lot of examples in the back
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:10.500
of the notebook who I have like 16 pages of examples of how to use it. But, but anyway,
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:15.300
it's called the habit journal and yeah, I'm excited about it. I think it'll be a good tool
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.380
to help people build better habits. Cool. And a lot of folks, I've heard from a lot of folks that
01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:23.220
really like the audio book. So if you folks aren't readers, go check out the audio book.
01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:31.780
People like us read atomic habits. So thanks again for your time, James. Really appreciate it, man.
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.380
Awesome. Thank you.
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:49.780
There you go. Hope that was helpful for you. Like I said, I really recommend the book atomic
01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:58.900
habits.com that journal that he's talking about is also available there. Folks, it's 2019. And if
01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:05.700
you are tired of bootstrapping alone, I've been running an online community, especially for
