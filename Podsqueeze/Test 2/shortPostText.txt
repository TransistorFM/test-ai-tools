"I've been in deep discussions with James Clear about the concept of identity-based habits. It's about focusing on who we want to become rather than what we want to achieve. This concept resonated so much that it's the first topic you'll encounter in his book, "Atomic Habits". He believes every action we adopt is a vote towards the person we want to become. It's powerful stuff!"

"In my recent conversation with James Clear, we addressed the struggle of upholding new habits, especially when their rewards are not instant. James emphasizes that habits, like entrepreneurship and exercise, need time and consistency to yield results. It's about riding out the 'valley of death', that initial discomfort and uncertainty."

"Had a thought-provoking chat with James Clear about the importance of showing up. It's all about making the new habit space our territory. He narrated a story of a reader who lost over 100 pounds by just showing up at the gym for five minutes each day. Small steps can lead to significant changes."

"Spoke with James Clear on the importance of social reinforcement in creating habits. We discussed Seth Godin's mantra, 'People like us do things like this,' which emphasizes the influence of group identity in our habits. It's about being part of a group that embodies the habits you aspire to have."

"James Clear and I delved into the concept of making small, incremental improvements to change our habits. He gave the analogy of heating an ice cube. Sometimes, we don't see the results until we hit that critical point, but that doesn't mean our efforts are wasted. The key is to keep going, even when you don't see immediate results. Because it's not the one viral article that launches a website, but the accumulation of all the previous articles. The same goes for habits."
