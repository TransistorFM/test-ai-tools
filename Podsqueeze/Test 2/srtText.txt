This is Transistor FM.

2
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,910
A product.
People Justin Jackson here.

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,940
And I've got a brand new interview
for you with James Clear,

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,390
who is the author of Atomic Habits,
a book that has really changed

5
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,890
my life since I've read it. And.
I don't want to give too much of

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,330
an intro.
I just want to get right into

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,770
the the actual interview.
If you like this, please reach out to

8
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,600
James on Twitter at James Clear.
And if you have comments about the

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,500
episode, reach out to me on Twitter.
I'm the letter M, The letter I,

10
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,900
Justin m I.
Justin here is me and James talking

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,870
about habits and how you can make
your life better one day at a time.

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,640
The book. Your books.
Been out for a while.

13
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,780
It's right here, Tom. Habits.
If you see it in an airport or

14
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,870
something near you.
How long has it been out now?

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,900
Uh, today is 100 days. Exactly.
No way. Yeah. So just.

16
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,710
Just over three months.
You know, I'm curious because

17
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:35,690
now it's been out for a while.
Is there one idea that you see that

18
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,170
people keep sharing, like one idea
that resonated from the book in

19
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,790
particular that gets shared more than
anything else on Twitter or whatever?

20
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,540
Um,
so I was curious about that myself.

21
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,610
When was, you know, writing the
book and thinking about it?

22
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,000
Because I kind of felt like,
all right, you know,

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,640
hopefully all these ideas are useful,
but what's the one thing that

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,740
people are going to latch on to?
Because sometimes you'll hear

25
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,190
that from authors that like,
there was one chapter or something

26
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,550
that was the chapter that really
stuck with people. Yeah.

27
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,030
Um, I'm grateful for the fact that
there are a variety of things,

28
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,590
but the there, um,
there are a few things.

29
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,090
So the first one is identity based
habits, which is chapter two. Yeah.

30
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,920
And that concept really seems to
have resonated with people.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,680
The idea of like trying to
reinforce your desired identity

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,410
and kind of like starting with who
you want to become rather than

33
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,780
what you want to achieve. Yes.
And I'm glad that it did because that

34
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,470
was the chapter I'd debated over the
most of where to put it in the book.

35
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,740
I have it at different points.
It was the first chapter.

36
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,650
It was the last chapter.
It ended up being the second one.

37
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,470
I also had this thought in my
head that it should be like

38
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,770
about midway through the book.
So it really jumped all over the

39
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,560
place.
But I ended up thinking, I feel like

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,980
this is one of the best ideas, so I
want to have it early so that people,

41
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,890
even if they don't finish the book,
they still come across this idea.

42
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,850
And I'm glad that that that
ended up working out well.

43
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,290
Um, the other one that people bring
up a lot is the two minute rule

44
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,370
and the idea of like scaling your
habits down to the point where

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,310
they take two minutes or less.
I think that that's like a very

46
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,110
actionable one.
You know, it's like, okay,

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,600
I know exactly what to do.
I wanted to do a workout,

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,900
but now I'll just focus on doing
five push ups or I wanted to

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,260
read 30 books this year,
and now I'll focus on reading one

50
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,130
page a day or something like that.
So I think the actionable ness

51
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,660
of that one also tends to stick.
And so going back to the identity

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,920
one, is this the idea that every
action you take or every habit

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,120
you develop is a vote for the
person you want to become. Right?

54
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,470
So that's kind of like my core,
um, philosophy behind it,

55
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:54,200
this idea that the way that we
develop beliefs about ourselves,

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,820
that we reinforce our self-image,
that we develop our identity to a

57
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,920
certain degree is largely reinforced
by the experiences and behaviors

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,520
that we perform over time.
So some aspects of your identity

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,500
are relatively fixed.
Like, for example,

60
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,970
if you're tall or short.
But even that idea that I am tall

61
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,210
or I am short, that's reinforced.
You learn that through

62
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,050
experiences in life.
Um, now there are many aspects

63
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,920
of your identity that are less
fixed than that, but are still

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,690
reinforced by your experiences.
So if you, you know, go,

65
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,130
if you write one sentence today,
you probably don't think about

66
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,970
yourself as am a writer.
But if you do that every day for six

67
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,240
months or nine months or a year,
at some point you turn around and

68
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,480
you think, Huh, maybe I am the
kind of person who is a writer or,

69
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,340
you know, if you if you study biology
every Tuesday night for 20 minutes

70
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,250
like you, at some point think,
guess I'm studious.

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,720
You know,
I keep doing this every week.

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,670
Like maybe this is the kind of
person I am. Yeah.

73
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,200
And so I like that idea that our
habits are like votes for the

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,350
the type of person we believe
that we are, that they build up

75
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,230
evidence of looking at ourselves
in a certain way.

76
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,300
And I like to phrase it that way,
not only because I believe that

77
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,120
it's true,
but also like beliefs and behavior

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,840
are kind of a two way street, right?
So like you can you'll hear people

79
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,350
say things like, well, you know,
just be positive or just believe

80
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,260
in yourself or fake it til you
make it or things like that.

81
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,970
And there's nothing necessarily
wrong with fake it till you make it

82
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,210
like it's it's fine to be positive
and believe things about yourself,

83
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,620
but it's a very short term
strategy because fake it till

84
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,620
you make it is asking you to
believe something about yourself

85
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,560
without having evidence for it.
You know, it's like that kind of

86
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,740
visualization stuff or mantra stuff
where you look at yourself in the

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,300
mirror and you tell yourself,
Am a writer.

88
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,790
I'm a writer,
even though you haven't written yet.

89
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,220
And so what I'm saying is similar,
but I think importantly different in

90
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,540
the sense that you let the behavior
lead the way rather than the belief.

91
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,500
And I think that's the best
lever we have for changing the

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,860
way that we look at ourselves,
which is to say, show up and write a

93
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,880
sentence every day and soon you're.
Going to have something to root

94
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,870
that new identity of I am a writer
in and it gives it's a much more,

95
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,980
I think, robust and long term way of
changing how you look at yourself.

96
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,140
Yeah, I think for me, the because
you first communicated that idea to

97
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:31,330
me in an airport in Denver. Yeah.
Remember that And the at the time in

98
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,860
my life I was not doing so good.
I was depressed.

99
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,420
I was, I think, cynical especially I
think cynical about people like you

100
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,410
that seem to have it all together.
That seemed to be really like doing

101
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,600
all the, the the good habits and
when you're not doing so good.

102
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,550
Looking at someone that you know,
seems to have it all together.

103
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,590
Just can make you more grumpy or
more cynical or more whatever.

104
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,450
But I remember you sitting down
and and kind of hashing this out

105
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:12,040
with me and that idea of Justin,
no matter where you're at right now

106
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:18,490
and no matter what you've done, you
could start today with one action.

107
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,810
So if you, you know,
go running today.

108
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,540
That might not make a big difference.
But then if you do it tomorrow

109
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,960
and then the next day and then
the next day and then the next

110
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,640
day at the end of the week,
you might say, well, wait a second,

111
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,710
I think I'm a runner. Right?
And maybe after a couple of weeks,

112
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,600
you might say, well, you know,
I'm going to get myself some runner

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,270
clothes and go and get some runner
clothes, and then I'm going to

114
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,750
get myself a good pair of shoes.
I'm going to install that Strava

115
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,810
app and all of a sudden you
could see yourself.

116
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,820
That was very that was a really
hopeful message for me when I was

117
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,330
really struggling to figure out.
It was way easier for me to be

118
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,740
cynical and just kind of look back at
all these people implementing good,

119
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,340
healthy processes and say, Well,
that's not for me, that's just for

120
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,530
people that whatever, you know.
But seeing hearing that gave me

121
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,260
hope to think, you know,
I could do that. I could.

122
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:22,220
And it's surprising how little
time it takes to accomplish that.

123
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,270
Is that something?
Has other people been kind of

124
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,020
referencing that, too?
Is that part of the the.

125
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,170
And maybe that's what's so good about
having it as chapter two, because

126
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,040
it gives you some hope, right?
Well, what's interesting is that that

127
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,280
process of changing in that way,
it's happening anyway.

128
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,950
You know, like I mean, if you think
back to like the beginning, like,

129
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,130
for example, if I think of my the
early days of my entrepreneurial

130
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,490
career, well, I didn't have any
entrepreneurs in my family.

131
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,800
I didn't have any close friends
who were entrepreneurs.

132
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,520
There was no reason for me to think
that's who I am or to feel like

133
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,550
I was externally validated with.
Like that was part of my identity.

134
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,190
I had no evidence of it.
And so early on,

135
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,130
just all I had was hope. Right?
Like the hope that, oh, maybe

136
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,920
I'll be able to build something,
maybe I'll be able to make this work.

137
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
Yeah, but then you start to show up.
And for me it was probably about

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,820
two years in is probably about
where the, where I kind of like

139
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,570
the scale tipped and I started
to think I am an entrepreneur.

140
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,260
Like that's part of who I am.
But it really took proving it to

141
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,150
myself that I can pay my bills
through this, you know, that I can,

142
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,510
like, actually have a lifestyle
and a career in this way.

143
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,660
I had to prove it for about two
years before I really started to

144
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,390
latch on to it and say,
This is who I am. Yeah.

145
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,790
And so my point is that's always
happening.

146
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,300
You're always you're continually
updating your beliefs about

147
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,480
yourself based on the experiences
that you're going through.

148
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,980
And all I'm talking about is simply
designing that process and a little

149
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,370
more careful or thoughtful way
rather than just kind of letting it

150
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,490
happen to you and be like, Well,
I guess I'll figure out who I am

151
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,120
based on what life throws at me
versus how about I figure out who I

152
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,630
am based on the votes that I cast
each day and what I decide to?

153
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,940
What happens?
I decide to follow? Yeah, Yeah.

154
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,230
Again, like that is a very
hopeful message for for someone

155
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,660
who's just kind of sitting back
and waiting for it to happen.

156
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:23,760
What what sustains you when you're in
the in the process but not there yet.

157
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,240
But like, like you mentioned
entrepreneur and you're like,

158
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,210
man, it took a long time. Yeah.
What? Sustained.

159
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,030
That's a really good question
because think a lot of habits

160
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,880
you know entrepreneurship is
certainly this way exercise is

161
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,850
this way where the the rewards of
a habit are often very delayed.

162
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,380
You know, like what's the reward for
working out for like three weeks?

163
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,360
Like, not really a whole lot.
Honestly,

164
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,200
your body hasn't really changed.
The scale is probably about the same.

165
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,800
You're probably just saw, you know,
like there probably isn't like a

166
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,920
whole lot to show for it.
Yeah, it's really not unless you

167
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,280
stick with that habit for three
months or six months or a year

168
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,280
that you actually start to see
the changes you were hoping to

169
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,310
get when you set out. Yeah.
And so there's kind of this like

170
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,690
Valley of Death in the beginning
where in a way it's sort of like

171
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,930
gets harder before it gets easier,
you know, it feels uncomfortable,

172
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,160
you feel sore and pain, you feel
uncertain when you walk in the gym.

173
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,900
You feel like people are judging you.
Yeah,

174
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,780
same way with starting a business,
you know, in a weird way, it's kind

175
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,880
of harder before it gets easier.
You start out,

176
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,910
but you're not making any money.
You feel stupid a lot of the time

177
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,450
because you don't know how to make
a sales call or what customers

178
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,810
are looking for or whether you're
even offering the right product.

179
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,160
Yeah, I remember when I first
started, I, I like said I didn't

180
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,500
know anybody, didn't have any
entrepreneurs in my family.

181
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,330
So I was like, Well,
I need to get to know some people.

182
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,630
So I sent a bunch of emails to
reach out and just ask if people

183
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,120
would chat on Skype for like 30
minutes or whatever.

184
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,630
And I remember sending those first
few and thinking, is this even?

185
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,030
Do people even do this?
Do people chat on Skype with people

186
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,700
that they haven't met before?
Like, is this a weird thing to ask?

187
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,670
You know, there's just a lot of
that uncertainty early on. Yeah.

188
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,150
So your point is,
I think a valid one, which is, well,

189
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,010
what do you do to get through that?
You know,

190
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,040
like how do you how do you kind of
get through that valley of death

191
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,100
while you're waiting for the long
term rewards to accumulate? Yeah.

192
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,930
And think that this is where
psychologists call it reinforcement

193
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,100
or an external reinforcer,
but you want some kind of

194
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,430
reinforcement that is enjoyable
in the moment so that you have a

195
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,880
reason to keep showing up. Okay.
So there are there are kind of

196
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,760
from a habit standpoint, there
are kind of two ways to do this.

197
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,320
First thing is just a strategic
choice about what type of habit

198
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,350
you choose to follow.
So if we go back to the exercise

199
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,190
example, well, not everybody has
to work out like a bodybuilder.

200
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,100
You know,
you could do Pilates or yoga or

201
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,180
go for a run or rock climbing or,
you know, all kinds of stuff. Yeah.

202
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,770
And so pick the form of a habit
that brings you the most joy,

203
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,130
that is most enjoyable to you.
Yeah, it's going to be a slog for,

204
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,750
you know,
you're going to have to swim for

205
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,030
months to see a change in your body.
You're going to have to cycle

206
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,110
for months.
You're going to have to lift

207
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,150
weights for months.
It doesn't really matter which

208
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,990
one you choose.
It's going to take a while. Yeah.

209
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,860
So you might as well choose the
one that's most exciting or

210
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,040
enjoyable to you. Yeah, yeah.
Same way with like,

211
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,100
imagine a reading habit, you know,
like you don't have to read.

212
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,690
You might feel like, Oh,
I have a business,

213
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,390
so I need to read business books.
But really,

214
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,870
ultimately the most important.
Thing is,

215
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,540
do you get in the habit of reading?
Do you fall in love with reading?

216
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,430
So if you need to start with sci
fi books or fantasy or something

217
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,040
like that, we'll start with that.
You know, like do do the one

218
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,950
that is intrinsically valuable
to you at first.

219
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,190
And once the habit is built,
then you can transition to some

220
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,310
of the other stuff. Yeah.
So that's one method for,

221
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,470
for kind of getting through that
valley of death. Yeah.

222
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:52,900
And I think this brings up maybe
a harder question, which is so,

223
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,690
you know, based on your book.
It's January and I'm thinking,

224
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,810
okay, you know, I haven't been
in the gym for seven years.

225
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,570
I used to love working out.
I'm going to go.

226
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,740
I got my streaks app on my phone,
start going.

227
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,740
And I've probably been I don't know,
I've probably been at least 18 days

228
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,220
or maybe even 20 days this month.
So it's great.

229
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,080
And I was surprised by how fast
I felt.

230
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,320
So the first day I felt like I
didn't belong. Felt awkward.

231
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,830
I don't know anybody here.
I'm walking in some of the machinery

232
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,730
I recognize, some I don't.
I have to like, you know,

233
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,420
find get back into a routine.
I have to find which exercise

234
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm going to do.
There's all these kind of

235
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,590
insecurities and questions.
But after a week,

236
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,390
I kind of felt like I belonged.
But I wonder if that's because

237
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,430
it was easier for me.
You know, I had this you know,

238
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,870
I'm I'm relatively I was already
relatively in shape.

239
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,400
So there's a big difference between
going in where you feel like, oh,

240
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,770
maybe I'm a few pounds overweight and
going in and being Â£200 overweight.

241
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,030
There's a big difference between,
you know, going in even as a

242
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,930
white male compared to, you know,
there's a big difference going

243
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,870
in and feeling like, well,
I've done these exercises before,

244
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,670
so I'm not completely out of my
element. And I'm wondering how.

245
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:32,580
I mean, are our habits like that
achievable because of privilege

246
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,980
and context and other things?
Like how much does that play into it?

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,910
And you know, if someone is walking
in and there are Â£200 overweight is.

248
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,440
You know, do they still have the
same chance of progress and success?

249
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,640
It just feels like such a big
mountain for them to go over for

250
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,750
sure. Yeah. There.
So this is one reason why I think

251
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,010
starting with small habits is so
incredibly important, because a

252
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,590
lot of the time when we think
about the outcome that you want,

253
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,340
so just to continue your weight
loss or exercise example, yeah,

254
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,490
everybody gets wrapped up in like,
Oh, I want to lose Â£100 or want to

255
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,870
lose Â£20 or whatever the number is,
but you forget about there.

256
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,550
Like all these little logistical and
emotional details that come along

257
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,760
with starting a new habit. Yeah.
So, you know, I'll often tell

258
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,120
the story about have this reader
who he ended up losing over Â£100

259
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,090
and one of the first things he
did was he went to the gym,

260
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,640
but he wasn't allowed to stay
for longer than five minutes.

261
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,780
So he drove to the gym, got out
of the car, did half an exercise,

262
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,680
got back in the car, drove home.
And it sounds ridiculous to people.

263
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,010
It sounds silly because it's like,
well, clearly exercising for

264
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,290
five minutes is not going to get
you in shape like it's not.

265
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,610
But what you realize is he was
mastering the art of showing up,

266
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,620
right?
He was becoming the type of person

267
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,410
that drove to the gym every day.
Yeah.

268
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,810
And when you're in that state,
right for him at that point,

269
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,140
that was the biggest shift was
can can just become the type of

270
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,920
person who gets in here, right?
Who overcomes the uncertainty or

271
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,170
feeling uncomfortable or feeling
judged.

272
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,830
And all those things are very
real hurdles to building a habit.

273
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,860
You know, like there's there are all
these little questions that need to

274
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,490
be answered for something like that.
Like, okay, I want to go to the gym.

275
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,850
Well, what time am I going to go?
I'm going to go before work or after

276
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,270
work? Yeah. What gym will I go to?
What route am I going to take to

277
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,550
get there?
Do I need to bring a water

278
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,260
bottle or is there like a water
fountain at the gym? Yeah.

279
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,850
And all those little questions
like that, like, you know,

280
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,490
whether or not you.
There's a water fountain at the gym.

281
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,790
It sounds small,
but if you already feel uncomfortable

282
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,520
and feel like you don't belong,
and then you always forget to bring

283
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,680
your water bottle and you're like,
oh, there's nothing ever and there's

284
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,230
never anything to drink there.
That's enough friction to get you

285
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,740
to quit in the beginning. Yeah.
So starting with something simple,

286
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,530
like, all I'm going to do is I'm
going to show up and I'm going to

287
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,760
do one exercise for five minutes,
and then I'm going to go, um,

288
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,630
that I think is a good way to start.
And it reminds me of what Steven

289
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,940
Pressfield wrote.
I think it was in the War of Art

290
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,640
where he said something to the
effect of like, if you sit down

291
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,420
each day at the computer and you
do your writing at some point,

292
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,000
at first it feels uncomfortable,
but at some point that becomes

293
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,360
your territory.
And I really like that phrasing

294
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,340
of it because for an animal,
for a wolf or something of a piece of

295
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,810
land does not become their territory
unless they spend time in it. Right.

296
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,680
Unless they are there each day. Yeah.
It has to become comfortable first.

297
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,100
And so for many people,
building habits, whether that's

298
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,070
getting into the gym or going to the
yoga studio or sitting your butt

299
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,240
in the chair and writing, you need
to make that space your territory.

300
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,450
And at the very first step is
not getting a result.

301
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,770
It's spending time there.
It's making that little bit of land

302
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,280
a zone where you feel like this
is where I belong each day. Yeah.

303
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,470
And and that that's a big emotional
hurdle to cross before you even worry

304
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,740
about any of the physical or like,
actual technical things to do.

305
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,630
Yeah. Yeah.
And I mean the other thing that

306
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:05,560
helped is I went with my wife and
it's funny because I felt like,

307
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,750
you know, I'm like Mr. Confident,
but she, she was like at one

308
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,720
point she's like, Justin,
you are so nervous right now.

309
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,420
Like,
she could tell how nervous I was.

310
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,970
And I thought I was, like,
keeping it all together.

311
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,070
And it just reminded me of like,
I'd been in gyms from the time I

312
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,470
was in grade nine all the way
through college.

313
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,570
It wasn't like it was unfamiliar,
but I was nervous because I was

314
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,390
unfamiliar.
There had been a seven year gap and

315
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,890
now I was like exploring this again,
worried about what these people

316
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,980
are thinking about me. Wow.
That guy looks like he's way

317
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,500
more fit than me.
You know, like all these thoughts

318
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,910
go through your head. And so.
Yeah, I think kind of figuring out

319
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,140
how you can like make a step and
sometimes maybe it's like going with

320
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,090
somebody so you at least have some
emotional because it's emotional.

321
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,840
It's nice to have someone to kind
of share the emotional burden,

322
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,470
right? For sure.
Well, if you come the thing that

323
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,610
ultimately what you're looking to
do is, like we just said, feel

324
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,220
like it's part of your territory.
And because there are other

325
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,100
people in that space,
what that also means is you're

326
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,160
looking to feel like you're part of
the tribe who goes there, right?

327
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,770
That you belong with the other
people who are in that room. Yeah.

328
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,980
And so it helps to what is a tribe?
Well, it's a group of people that you

329
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,670
get along with, that you bond with,
that you belong to over something

330
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,750
else, over some shared interest.
And in other words, it's a group in

331
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,870
a lot of ways of friends, friends
who share some kind of interest.

332
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,770
So these are your gym friends? Yeah.
Well, if you go with your wife,

333
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,880
then you automatically have at least
one person in the tribe that you are

334
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,080
friends with, you do belong with.
And so think that helps you get

335
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,960
over that hurdle a little bit.
You're not you're no longer

336
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,140
facing that challenge alone.
You know, before it was like,

337
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,920
I am trying to get fit. Now it is.
We are trying to get fit.

338
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,780
And that that helps a lot with the
kind of the mental feeling of like,

339
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,860
do I belong or not? Yeah.
I've also found sorry, I don't

340
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,570
mean to stay on this too long,
but it's so fresh that the other

341
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,930
thing I found myself doing
because I'm interested in the

342
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:23,430
emotional friction behind habits.
And so the other thing I was

343
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,930
doing is I was going in there
and I'm uncomfortable,

344
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,130
so I'm trying to act really tough,
but I'm not tough at all.

345
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm like, but I'm you know,
when people look at me,

346
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm kind of like scowling when like,
I'm not being friendly.

347
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,880
I'm not being myself. And.
I was thinking about that and

348
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,470
thinking like when you're kind
of inward focused and you're in

349
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,450
a new environment and you're
trying to develop a new habit,

350
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,850
but you're inward focused,
it really is. It doesn't really help.

351
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,770
And so I had to kind of turn
that around and go, okay,

352
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,410
I got to start being friendly.
I got to start saying hi to these

353
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,270
people because if I wave at this
person and it feels good, like they

354
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,580
respond with a smile and that happens
again next time and again next time.

355
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,490
That's a little bit of a reward
for me.

356
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,320
That's going to keep me going to
the gym.

357
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,690
But if I keep going here with this,
like, tough scowl on my face, I,

358
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,690
you know,
and it's hard because you feel you

359
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,980
you feel like you don't belong.
You feel nervous and you kind of

360
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,890
default to these old,
these weird behaviors.

361
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,780
But I and it took a little bit of
time, but I realized, okay, I got it.

362
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:41,030
Now I got to get in the habit of
of smiling and saying hello when

363
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,860
I'm in the gym.
Not just being like,

364
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,050
in my own zone and pretending
I'm somebody I'm not. Right.

365
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,030
Well, that's one thing that kind of
helps you start to belong with or

366
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,820
become part of the rest of the tribe.
You know, like just a friendly

367
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,670
behavior helps you start to
develop friendships with some of

368
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,040
those other people that are there.
Yeah,

369
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,730
there was a study that I wanted to
cite in Atomic Habits but couldn't.

370
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,850
I couldn't find it to track it down.
But I read about it years ago where

371
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,100
the YMCA ran a survey and when they
surveyed people who were joining the

372
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,050
gym, the thing that got them to join
were the different classes offered,

373
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,440
the equipment that was in the gym.
Basically facilities and features

374
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,810
were the things that got people
in for the first time.

375
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,150
Yeah, but then when they
surveyed members who had been

376
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,540
there for over a year, the thing
that got people to stick, nobody

377
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,200
mentioned features or facilities.
Everybody mentioned friendships. Yes.

378
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,980
And so the people who actually stayed
at the gym or kept their membership

379
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,280
were the ones who ended up developing
friendships with other people there.

380
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,010
Yeah, and I think you're right.
Ultimately, the thing that gets

381
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,380
you to come back is like,
do I enjoy coming here?

382
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,210
Does it mean I get to see some
of my friends?

383
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,370
Does it mean I get to hang out
with people I like?

384
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,160
Or, you know,
it's really the sense of belonging

385
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,230
that gets habits to stick.
And the the action itself is just

386
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,840
kind of like something that's
happening along the way. Yes.

387
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,050
But there's a step before that
that we kind of skipped over,

388
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,100
which is like, how do you even
choose a habit in the first place?

389
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,060
Like, how did how does that
happen in the sense of I might

390
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:15,230
not know what's good for me.
So how does that come into this?

391
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,230
Yeah, well, there are a lot of
ways to answer that question,

392
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,730
so I'll just share a couple thoughts
that are that come to mind.

393
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,410
So the first thought that comes
to mind is this question from I

394
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,600
first heard from Seth Godin,
which I think it's just a great

395
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,800
question, which is what is it for?
And so this is a question that we

396
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,110
need to ask ourselves when we're
trying to build a new habit,

397
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,080
which is what does this habit for?
What is the what am I actually

398
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,020
trying to achieve here?
Because the correct habit to

399
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,130
choose is very different based on
what your goals are, what you're

400
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,130
hoping to get as an outcome,
what kind of lifestyle you want.

401
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,770
Um, and you know, so for example, the
habit of making 20 sales calls a day.

402
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,390
Well, if what it's for is to increase
revenue and to build a successful

403
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,250
business, that's a wonderful thing.
If you hate making sales calls and

404
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,490
you want to spend less time working
and more time with your family, that

405
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,730
could be a terrible habit to build.
It just depends on what it's for.

406
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,760
So that's one question to ask.
But you are correct that we often

407
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,590
don't know what we need in the
moment and think part of that's

408
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,380
just a challenge of life and a
challenge of self-awareness and,

409
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,270
you know, knowing what you need.
But life is a very complex system.

410
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,780
And so figuring out the right thing
for that is sometimes it's just

411
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,810
impossible or too many moving parts.
Yeah.

412
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,850
So I tend to default to two
possible answers.

413
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,670
The first answer is we all need
things that are so boring that

414
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,190
we don't think about them but
are incredibly important for

415
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,700
showing up each day.
So did you sleep eight hours?

416
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,340
Are you drinking enough water?
Are you spending a little bit of

417
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,220
time walking outside or getting
a little bit of sunlight?

418
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,270
Do you exercise consistently
whatever form is interesting to you?

419
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,840
Are you spending some time
reading and soaking up new ideas?

420
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm not saying you have to do
all that stuff every day, but my

421
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,620
point is, like, those are things
that most people would be like,

422
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,140
Yeah, of course you should sleep
and read more books and exercise.

423
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,710
Everybody knows that's good.
Yeah, but your time is almost never

424
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,730
going to be wasted by making sure
you do one of those things right.

425
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,670
It's a it's a fundamental that's
worth spending time on that's

426
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,400
worth coming back to.
That's worth reminding yourself of,

427
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,480
even if you aren't sure the ideal
perfect place to focus in your life.

428
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,870
Yeah, so that's the first answer.
Come back to the fundamentals.

429
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,800
The second answer is more broad.
Can't.

430
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,680
I can't be specific with it
because it depends on each person.

431
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,810
But the broad application is what I
would call broad funnel type filter.

432
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,280
So whenever you're trying to figure
out where to focus, you need a really

433
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,300
broad range of research, try to
get as many options as possible,

434
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,350
then apply a really tight, strict
filter to it and just focus on the 1

435
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,830
or 2 best options that you've found.
Okay, so for example, I just finished

436
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,860
atomic Habits a few months ago,
so now I'm thinking should write

437
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,350
a second book if I should.
What should that be about?

438
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,400
You know, and I don't know right now.
So I'm in the broad funnel stage.

439
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,800
So I want to lay out as many
options as possible.

440
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,720
I want to brainstorm a thousand
titles.

441
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,210
I want to look at all the top
books on Amazon.

442
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,720
I want to browse my best performing
tweets and see if there's a possible

443
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,960
thread for a book in there.
I want to look everywhere I can and

444
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,250
just list all of that stuff in the
same spreadsheet and maybe I got 1200

445
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,570
ideas on there, really broad funnel.
But then I need to apply a very

446
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,940
tight filter.
Is this something I'm interested

447
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,760
in enough to spend two or 3 or 4
years working on?

448
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,150
Is it a topic of broad appeal to
a general audience?

449
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,490
Are there going to be a lot of
people that like this? Yeah.

450
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,300
Is this something that people that
can actually turn into something

451
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,420
actionable, You know, like can
people use this in their daily life?

452
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,410
Is this a topic that has a lot of
stories that could tell? Right?

453
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,510
Can I actually make this
entertaining or, you know,

454
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,960
latch on to other interesting stories
to make the book readable? Yes.

455
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,390
So, you know, and those are just
some of the filters.

456
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,050
But there my point is that you
want some period of very broad

457
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,110
exploration and then once you have
a lot of options, you want to

458
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,650
really tighten it down based on
that question, what is this for?

459
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,230
So in my case,
the question I'm using is, well,

460
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,560
it's for writing a good book,
one that's highly actionable, one

461
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,150
that sells a lot of copies, one that
people find useful and so on. Yeah.

462
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,630
And so I think if you combine that
broad funnel type filter strategy and

463
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,480
that question of what is it for,
that can maybe give you some

464
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,090
more specific answers.
But even if you don't come up with

465
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,240
something good there, you can always
focus on the fundamentals. Yeah.

466
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,020
And the other thing,
when you mentioned Seth Godin,

467
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,850
he has this other line,
which is people like us do things

468
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,180
like this. I love that line.
I wish I had thought it up.

469
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,230
But yeah, it's so good.
It's such a great like, mantra.

470
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:56,960
And what's interesting about it
is like for me.

471
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:03,150
One thing that made me start thinking
about healthy habits was hanging out

472
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,550
with people who had healthy habits.
And and in some ways it was

473
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:15,090
really lucky and fortunate.
Like, you know, like you guys invited

474
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,620
me to that retreat. You did? Yep.
And in some ways,

475
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,020
I'm thankful you guys invited a
loser like me because I was,

476
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,240
like, hanging out in that group.
You know, I came, and at first I

477
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,280
was cynical and grumpy and.
And eventually, you know,

478
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,310
just looking around that group,
I realized, man, these people

479
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:41,370
like this do things like this.
And my cynicism, which before

480
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,820
would have been like, Wow,
people like that do stuff like that,

481
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,550
you know, it it went down.
And then all of a sudden I was like,

482
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:52,170
okay, well, if people like this
do things like this, that's what

483
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:57,670
I need to do. And I think.
For folks that are, you know,

484
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,950
thinking like, okay, well,
how do I know what good habits are?

485
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:07,100
There are so many things that I
would have never been.

486
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,230
You know, what do you call it?
There's like the there's the

487
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,110
stages of habits or whatever.
But I would have never even had the

488
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,070
cue if I had not first observed it.
And then notice like, Oh, wait,

489
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,360
they're doing that.
They're doing that.

490
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,270
They're doing that.
I'm the odd man out.

491
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:28,270
And that's what motivated me to want
to to pursue some of that stuff.

492
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,510
But if I hadn't been in that group
and felt like, wait a second,

493
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:36,490
like if I want to belong here, I got
to I've got to I got to up my game,

494
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,170
right? It would have never happened.
And so people like us do.

495
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,260
Things like this has been really
helpful for me.

496
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,530
Yeah, I love that phrase.
And one of the reasons I said that,

497
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,890
oh, I wish I had thought that up
is because I think it applies so

498
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,770
deeply to a lot of the ideas and
atomic habits.

499
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:59,010
It applies to how socially
reinforced our habits are.

500
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,360
I think this is you know,
I wrote about this in the book,

501
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,090
may have a whole chapter on it.
Chapter nine is all about that.

502
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,590
But I think I still undersold
the importance of how socially

503
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,420
reinforced our habits are.
Um, and then it also references this

504
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:18,160
the importance of a shared identity.
I think that ultimately a shared

505
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,160
identity is really one of the
most powerful forces for getting

506
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,740
habits to stick.
You know, like if you look at, um,

507
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,180
if you look at it in a big way,
you can look at like religions,

508
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,000
you know, people,
religions are really interesting

509
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,810
places to look for habits.
People get in the habit of going to

510
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:40,660
church every Sunday for 50 years,
largely because it's reinforced the

511
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,920
other people in their neighborhoods
go the people on their block go.

512
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,220
They see their friends there.
They it's a very socially

513
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,450
reinforced habit.
Yes,

514
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,770
same thing is true in smaller ways.
Like let's say you move into a

515
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,550
new house and you walk outside on
Tuesday night and you see all your

516
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,790
neighbors have their recycling
bins out and you're like, Huh?

517
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,030
People like us do things like this.
Like people who live in this

518
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,890
neighborhood recycle on Tuesday
nights.

519
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,660
Guess we need to sign up for
recycling.

520
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,040
And there are really almost an
infinite range of examples that

521
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,340
are like that,
both large and small. Yeah.

522
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,890
Where our habits are,
we notice them because the

523
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,860
people around us are doing them,
which is what the portion is.

524
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,480
You referenced. We desire to do them.
We crave to follow through on

525
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,740
them because by doing the same
we fit in or signal to the other

526
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,740
people around us, Hey, I get it.
I'm part of the tribe too.

527
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,600
Yeah, it becomes easier to do it
because sometimes you have friends

528
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,030
helping you out, you know?
Like it's like having a spotter

529
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,030
at the gym.
Like, Oh, people like us help each

530
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,570
other out when a set is hard. Yeah.
And then ultimately it becomes

531
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,530
satisfying because you enjoy
being praised for it.

532
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,810
You know, other people are like,
Hey, it was great to see you at

533
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,470
church on Sunday or, you know, really
good job on that workout today.

534
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,940
And that feels good to be
praised for fitting in. Yeah.

535
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,880
And so in that way,
socially reinforced habits or the

536
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,650
collective identity, it hits all four
stages of habit formation. Yeah.

537
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,850
Um, and I,
I knew that when I was writing it,

538
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,090
but I don't think I gave it as
much importance as I should have.

539
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,580
It's a very powerful driver of
behavior in the long run.

540
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,960
Yeah, totally.
And I think this is why cynicism

541
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:34,060
is such a toxic attitude.
And, you know, I'm I guess I'm

542
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:39,400
in Gen X, I'm born in 1980.
There's a lot of cynicism in Gen X,

543
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,400
And then millennials also have a
little bit of this, too.

544
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,580
And I think and actually,
to be honest,

545
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,980
everybody has a baby boomers have it.
When, you know,

546
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,780
if you're a 50 year old programmer
and you get hired at a startup

547
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:58,540
where the CEO is 20 years old,
we kind of default to cynicism.

548
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,730
And it, it it's such a blocker
when you're like trying to observe

549
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,840
those norms like, oh, wait, like
people like us do things like this.

550
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,720
Cynicism allows you to go, Well,
yeah, people like that do stuff

551
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,320
like that. That's good for them.
That's good for James Clear.

552
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:22,520
But you know, that's not good for me.
And when I'm trying to kind of

553
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,990
reveal from my experience,
for anyone that ever watches this or

554
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:31,790
listens to this is that you really
do need to step outside that and

555
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,820
at least be open to this idea that
your life could get better and it

556
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:43,010
could just be going, okay, well,
I'm going to I'm going to vote for

557
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,380
who I'm going to be today and I'm
going to vote for who I'm going to be

558
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,640
tomorrow and I'm going to keep going.
The other thing in the book that

559
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,680
really helped me and I'm
probably going to butcher it so

560
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,310
you clean up after I do it,
but you show this grid.

561
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,030
So imagine like on this side of
your day, it's like, okay,

562
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,360
I make a good decision.
So it goes up and then I make

563
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,270
another good decision goes up.
But then I make a bad decision.

564
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,370
Like I eat a tub of ice cream and,
you know, sometimes eating the tub of

565
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:15,920
ice cream is, like, debilitating.
It's like, wow, I'm done.

566
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,040
I ate the tub of ice cream.
I suck at this.

567
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,620
I'm just going to go again into
bed and forget about it.

568
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,280
And in your grid, you show weight,
but you're still up here.

569
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,970
Like you can just make another
good decision and then you're

570
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,120
back up again.
And I like that idea of kind of

571
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,570
navigating your ideas,
not being so hard on ourselves.

572
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,490
Did I kind of get that right? Yeah.
So this is the I don't know if you

573
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,520
can see it, but this is the image.
Oh, yeah, yeah. But it's it's a.

574
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,230
It's this idea that, like,
the difference between a good

575
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,350
day and a bad day is often just
a series of choices, Right?

576
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,540
And you can win each little moment,
right?

577
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,810
You can win each decisive moment.
Just because you ate the tub of

578
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,210
ice cream doesn't mean you can't
win the next moment. Yes.

579
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:04,400
Um, and, and so one thing that I
was thinking about when I wrote

580
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,240
that is this concept that I call
decisive moments, this idea that

581
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,600
there are a few choices each day,
maybe somewhere between, say,

582
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,500
five and ten, that kind of
determine the next chunk of time.

583
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,250
And so, so for example, there's a
moment for me each morning where

584
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,810
I sit down and either I open up
Evernote and I start writing the

585
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,980
next article I'm going to work on,
or I go to ESPN and I check the

586
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,630
latest sports news. Yeah.
And what happens in the next hour is

587
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,900
really determined by what happens
in like the first 45 seconds.

588
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,140
You know, like, do I do I go to
Evernote or do I go to ESPN?

589
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,070
And so that is a decisive moment
in my language.

590
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,880
That's like a moment that determines
if I can master those 45 seconds,

591
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,670
then I can end up mastering the
next hour That comes afterward

592
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,970
almost automatically. Yeah.
Um, same thing is true.

593
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,000
There's a moment each night,
like 515 or so, my wife gets home

594
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,620
from work and either we change
into our workout clothes or we,

595
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,530
like, sit on the couch and watch
reruns of the office and order

596
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,620
Indian food or whatever. Yeah.
And both of those nights are

597
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,460
good nights, but the moment to
master is do we change into our

598
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,530
workout clothes or not?
If we do that,

599
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,260
it only takes a few minutes.
Everything else for the next two

600
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,060
hours is already decided.
We'll get in the car,

601
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,210
we'll drive to the gym, we'll do
the reps like it's all it's all

602
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,810
pretty much done at that point. Yeah.
So the reason I like bringing

603
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:28,080
that up or like thinking about
that is you start to realize

604
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,150
there really isn't that much
that you need to master really.

605
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:36,470
You just are trying to focus your
attention on a few key decisive

606
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,560
moments throughout the day.
It's kind of like applying judo

607
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,230
to your life, you know,
it's like apply the pressure and the

608
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,320
leverage at just the right point and
then the next hour kind of falls

609
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,310
into place automatically. Yeah.
Um, and so I like that because

610
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,830
once you realize that once you
kind of identify those high

611
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:57,530
leverage decision points,
you can organize your day and your

612
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,670
environment around those things.
You know, if I know that those 45

613
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,210
seconds where I'm choosing between
Evernote or ESPN is a real key

614
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:10,640
moment, well, I could install freedom
and then I could block ESPN from

615
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,600
8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and that takes
care of that decisive moment and

616
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,750
it increases the odds that I'm
going to open a note instead. Yes.

617
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,220
But anyway, so little choices
like that are easier to make once

618
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,770
you've identified some of those
key points of leverage. Yeah.

619
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,400
And you talk in the book like
there's some tricks to where you

620
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,270
can make things automatic,
like you talk about near y'all buying

621
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,810
a little device that just shuts off
his internet every night at ten.

622
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:42,680
Yeah, yeah. Outlet timer. Yeah.
And that's what's brilliant about

623
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,220
that is like it shuts it off like,
especially if it's in the

624
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,870
basement or whatever.
Like you're not going to go

625
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,150
downstairs and like,
fiddle around with it.

626
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:56,090
And then it's just, it's just that's
what happens, right? If you like.

627
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,440
If ESPN was really killing you,
you could just cancel your cable

628
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,040
subscription. That might be a bit.
But then you would you go to watch

629
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,680
ESPN. You can't, right? It's done.
By the way, you mentioned this in

630
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,970
the book, too, but it's so funny
how certain people's what what is a

631
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,770
trigger for some people is not for
others like this for me is not a

632
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,850
that's not a temptation at all. Yeah.
It doesn't even enter your worldview.

633
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,840
That's an enter my worldview,
but it shows you how identity is

634
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,940
so much a part of this.
Like if I was hanging out with a

635
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,020
bunch of Oilers fans every
single day and this happened in

636
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,080
the co work office, you know,
there's a few people and they're

637
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,430
watching Oilers games, you know,
on, on their computers.

638
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,400
And I realized, like,
if I want to talk to them, I've got

639
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,240
to start watching an Oilers games so
people like us do things like this.

640
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,420
And so I started developing this
habit of watching Oilers games

641
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,770
when before I didn't even care.
I mean, think this is one of the

642
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,430
reasons why sports is so tribal.
Why people get so emotional about

643
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,690
it is that it becomes a connection
point for the relationships.

644
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,230
It's not even the the game is
actually no one would ever say that

645
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,570
because everybody acts like the game
is the thing that matters the most.

646
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,140
But in a weird way, it's kind of a
secondary thing, you know, really.

647
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,490
Like when think back, for me,
sports is a way for my brother

648
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,400
and I to connect and for us to
have something to text about and

649
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,220
chat about throughout the week.
It's a thing that, you know,

650
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,520
it's a reason for my dad and I to get
together in person and to go to games

651
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,750
and hang out and like it's it's all
the other stuff that it provides that

652
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,910
makes it so deeply meaningful. Yeah.
And then you, you know,

653
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,440
you end up assigning a lot of
that emotion to how the team does

654
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,050
on the field as well and what
the score is on the scoreboard.

655
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,260
But yeah, so yeah,
it's a good example there.

656
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,730
On that topic then, and this is
Corey Stone is asking this in. Chat.

657
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,510
But there's a lot of people on
Twitter that asked us to, given

658
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,980
that example that you just gave.
If your meaningful relationships.

659
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,480
Are engaging in habits that might not
be good for you or that you want to

660
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,080
change. How do you navigate that?
So if you're really feeling like I

661
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,070
got to I got to stop watching sports,
it's just like I get a little

662
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,690
bit and then I just go crazy.
But I still want to have a

663
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,870
relationship with my brother.
This is where it gets complex,

664
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,610
especially if you're married to
somebody.

665
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:23,160
Like if your wife is is like your
wife is at least somewhat inclined to

666
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,490
want to go to the gym, I'm guessing.
But if she was like, No,

667
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,650
I just want to watch Netflix and
order Indian food.

668
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:32,010
That's all I want to do. Yeah.
How do you start to navigate

669
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,740
those things?
Yeah, those are good questions.

670
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,750
I mean, it's really hard because
especially if it's a person who

671
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,960
you want to stay in your life,
you know, think first of all,

672
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,360
I just want to say so I have some
things I want to add to this,

673
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:51,150
but I feel like it's worth noting
that this question comes up a lot.

674
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,860
And I think the reason it comes up
a lot is because we all know that

675
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,370
actually there isn't a good easy
answer and that it's like just a hard

676
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,340
part of life, you know what I mean?
Like everybody wants it's one of

677
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,480
those things we want to keep
asking about in hopes that, oh,

678
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,470
maybe there'll be an easy way to
resolve this.

679
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,440
But I think we all know, like,
it's a challenge. Yeah.

680
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,620
Um, now that said,
there are a few things you can do.

681
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,040
So first thing is,
sometimes your friends and family

682
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,340
want to do something different
than how you want to change.

683
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,980
So like you're you want to stick
to a new diet.

684
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,340
They want to eat the old way or
something like that.

685
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,920
Yeah, well,
you want to start doing yoga?

686
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,530
They couldn't care less about yoga.
They don't want to go to class

687
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,280
with you, things like that.
Well, if that's the case,

688
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,060
then for certain habits, you don't
have to, like, fire your friends

689
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,260
and family to be able to do that.
But what you can, what you do need

690
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,100
or what can be really useful is
having like a sacred space where

691
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,880
that occurs, where I'm not saying
you need to do this with me,

692
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,150
but just don't make it harder on me,
right? Just don't conflict with.

693
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,810
So, you know, the yoga example is an
easier one where it's like, well,

694
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,880
maybe you need to go to a yoga studio
away from the friends and family that

695
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,360
aren't interested and start to build
friendships with people who are.

696
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,430
You know, I'm not saying you need
to get rid of your old friends,

697
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,130
but maybe it'd be helpful to build
a couple new ones who are into

698
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,490
yoga so that you have like a safe
space for that habit to live.

699
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:18,960
Yeah, so that's one thing.
Then there's the second piece,

700
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,980
which is sometimes you're
building a habit that you do want

701
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,470
the person to like join you on,
to come along with you.

702
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,420
You know,
you're working out and you would

703
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,960
love for your spouse to join you
at the gym or something like that.

704
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,700
And everybody know like it would
be good, but they feel maybe

705
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,790
they feel less comfortable there
than you do or maybe they feel,

706
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,570
you know, you were previously an
athlete and they were not.

707
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,970
And so you feel kind of
comfortable in the gym.

708
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,370
You've been there before in
years past, but for them,

709
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,620
it's like new and weird and,
you know, they feel like they're

710
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,070
being judged and whatever.
If you're dealing with a case like

711
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,240
that, the the thing that I try to
keep in mind and I can tell you

712
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,750
from working with my own family,
it can be incredibly useful,

713
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,130
is praise the good, ignore the bad.
It's very hard to do.

714
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,790
It's very the difficult part
about it is not doing it on an

715
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,160
individual basis.
It's that this needs to be the

716
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,580
new lifestyle for you.
So when they do the thing that

717
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,480
you're asking them to do, don't.
Basically another way to phrase this

718
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,810
is don't criticize people for doing
what you were hoping they would.

719
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:25,710
You know, like there are so many
times when the introverted kid

720
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,530
in the family will come down to
the dinner table and it's like,

721
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:32,340
oh, look who decided to join us.
And it's like, well, they finally did

722
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,540
the thing that you were hoping they
would do and engage with everybody,

723
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,910
and now they just feel like
they're getting criticized for it.

724
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:45,240
Or you go to the gym and your
spouse decides to join you and

725
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,430
they do a few sets and then they
feel like they're done.

726
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,830
And you say, Well,
that was a pretty short workout.

727
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,090
And what you should be saying is,
I think it's great that you got

728
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,340
in here tonight, right?
Like you weren't feeling it, but you

729
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:01,140
were still able to make it in. Yeah.
And so praise the good, ignore the

730
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,090
bad and if you can do that in the
long run, what ends up happening is

731
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,710
everybody likes feeling praised,
everybody likes feeling rewarded.

732
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,700
They like to.
It feels satisfying to do something

733
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,000
that the people who love you and
who are around you praise you for.

734
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,330
And so at first you go to the
gym and they say, Hey,

735
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,500
I'm really proud of you for getting
in here tonight. Good job. Yeah.

736
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,910
And it doesn't seem like much,
but then after two months and three

737
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,420
months and ten months of that,
you turn around a year later and

738
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,180
they might never even say it.
But implicitly,

739
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,330
what they've realized is.
Damn, every time I go to the gym,

740
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,550
it feels good.
They like, they compliment me.

741
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,440
Yeah. And that.
So now all of a sudden you start

742
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,740
to associate going to the gym
with feeling good.

743
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,910
And this is a really long game
play because it takes a while

744
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:52,560
for that to reinforce itself.
But you know, same thing like the

745
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,370
introverted kid at the table sits
down and they say something that

746
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:57,990
happened today and it's like,
Oh, that's awesome.

747
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,520
Thanks for sharing that with us.
You know, and.

748
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,020
On that individual night.
That one night at dinner doesn't

749
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,020
count for a lot.
But if every time they speak up,

750
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,560
they're rewarded for it,
then all of a sudden now they have

751
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,200
a reason to start doing that more
in the months and years to come.

752
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,650
So it takes a while,
but I think that that's like an

753
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,670
effective way to gradually nudge
people in the right direction.

754
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,620
Yeah, there's someone in the chat
that's saying they need to apply

755
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,610
that idea to themselves to avoid
feeling guilty for not doing enough.

756
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,360
So instead of reinforcing,
Oh you idiot, you didn't go to

757
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,720
the gym again, you fatty.
You know, like, that's not helpful.

758
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,830
There's the self-talk.
It can work with self talk as well.

759
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,180
This is why I think small habits
can be so useful in some ways,

760
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,690
even on the bad days, because like,
let's say you're in that situation

761
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:47,810
you just said where it's like,
Oh, you know, skip the gym again.

762
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:52,070
Well, you can still do one pushup or
one air squat or whatever before

763
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,130
you go do a set of ten air squats
before you hop in bed tonight.

764
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,340
And it's not going to transform
your body.

765
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,910
But that's not really the point.
The point is to prove to yourself

766
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:04,700
that it wasn't a good day.
I didn't have the best

767
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,250
motivation or energy.
Had a long day at work,

768
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:11,000
but I still am not the type of
person who misses workouts, right?

769
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,320
I still prove to myself I still cast
a vote for being that kind of person.

770
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,910
I didn't let a day go by without
doing nothing, and that can

771
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:23,630
count for a lot in the long run.
And so sometimes small habits

772
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,930
are less about the outcome they
deliver and more about the

773
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,400
identity they reinforce. Yeah.
And I've actually found, you know,

774
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:38,090
another thing I, I tried to I'm
implementing in the new Year is I

775
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:42,560
decided to quit drinking alcohol.
And right now it's ostensibly for

776
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,680
this goal of hitting a revenue mark.
Once I hit the goal,

777
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:49,820
then I can have a drink.
But the deeper motivation for me

778
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,380
was I just realized like.
It just makes it's a depressant.

779
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,160
It's like there's a bunch of
reasons that it's not good for me.

780
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,990
And so my my excuse or my way of
trying it out is saying, well,

781
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:06,620
I'm going for this goal.
But it's been interesting in social

782
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,360
situations because all my friends
still drank and that's fine with me.

783
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:15,650
But sometimes just sharing the goal,
Oh, I'm just doing this because

784
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,890
I'm going after this thing.
And and you talk about how goals

785
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:23,390
are sometimes helpful in setting
your direction, you know, like,

786
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,950
okay, I'm pointed this way now,
and sometimes sharing that with

787
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,800
people is helpful.
The other thing is I think eventually

788
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,010
if I just keep doing this,
just for me to say, well,

789
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:39,470
I'm a non drinker now. Yeah.
And so I can still go and have

790
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,980
my favorite.
And it's also nice having a

791
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,950
thing that you like.
So my favorite non-alcoholic

792
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:50,210
drink is a non alcoholic Caesar.
It's like a Bloody Mary.

793
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,320
And to have that drink,
it's like kind of spicy.

794
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:58,550
There's a reward there.
I also have this social crutch that I

795
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:04,010
can use in a situation, you know,
and if somebody asks me about it,

796
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,670
I also have this new identity,
which is, Oh, I'm a non drinker now,

797
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,610
I just don't drink.
And you talked about that.

798
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,160
There's some research behind that.
I know you've mentioned it a lot,

799
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,360
but it's like I'm trying to quit
smoking versus I'm a non smoker,

800
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,260
right? Is that correct? Correct.
Right. Yeah.

801
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:27,210
So I think that that can be
really helpful. Yeah. Having, um.

802
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,560
Think what you're explaining here,
the situation that you're going

803
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,150
through,
this experience you're having is

804
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,840
kind of it's illustrating this
process of identity change, right?

805
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,420
It started with, oh, I'm just going
to put it off for a little while

806
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,150
while I'm attacking this goal.
Yeah, but then you're casting so

807
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,640
many votes for like, you know
what I have haven't dragging.

808
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,010
Like I'm kind of benefiting from it.
Like, maybe this is part of my

809
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,020
identity now.
Maybe I'm a non drinker.

810
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,830
Um, and so anyway, yeah,
I think you're definitely on the

811
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,110
right track there. Yeah.
And actually, this is a good time

812
00:49:55,110 --> 00:50:01,110
to bring up two Twitter questions.
Maria Aldridge asks,

813
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,820
How do you maintain habits?
Ask him about maintaining habits

814
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,150
for people with depression,
anxiety or attention deficit.

815
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,670
Do you want to try to tackle that?
Yeah.

816
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,460
Um, so I've tried to be careful about
saying that atomic habits is about

817
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,760
building habits and breaking breaking
bad habits, building good ones.

818
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,880
But it's not a book on addiction.
It's not a book on depression.

819
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,240
It's not a book about anxiety or
ADHD or any of these other

820
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,890
disorders or ailments.
Um, and I don't consider myself

821
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,620
an expert on addiction.
However,

822
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:39,000
something interesting has happened.
So I published the book and I

823
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,830
have had a ton of speaking
requests recently.

824
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,650
And so I've been doing speeches
at conferences and companies and

825
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:48,570
different events and whatever. Yeah.
And so many times I get someone that

826
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,350
comes up to me afterward or that asks
a question during Q&A that talks

827
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:57,210
about how useful the book was for
their son who had ADHD or their

828
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,600
cousin was a meth addict and then was
able to like start to, you know,

829
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,810
right the ship by employing some of
these techniques or whatever. Yeah.

830
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,030
Which is great,
which is very gratifying.

831
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,190
I still stand by my original
statement.

832
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,860
I'm not an expert on addiction.
I don't want to like take a

833
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,310
strong stance with this stuff.
But what I've realized is that

834
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,450
the principles that lay out in
atomic habits are really about

835
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,930
how human behavior works.
It's about how habits are formed

836
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,160
and whether that habit is something
extreme like an addiction or picking

837
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,500
your skin or OCD or ADHD or whatever,
or whether it's something more

838
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,170
moderate like meditating for
three minutes a day.

839
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:37,440
Yes,
the fundamentals tend to be similar.

840
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,890
And so I'm not going to say that
the book offers a prescription

841
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:44,940
for overcoming addictions.
But what I will say is you'd be hard

842
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,510
pressed to find tactics in the book
that wouldn't at least help. Right?

843
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,940
That wouldn't at least nudge people
in the right direction. Yeah.

844
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,470
Um, I have heard from a few
readers who specifically have

845
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:59,490
said that they had ADHD and that
they found the book very helpful.

846
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:03,420
Um, environment design, for whatever
reason, has been something that's

847
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,270
come up multiple times for folks
who have struggled with that. Yeah.

848
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,510
So, you know, it's, I think it's
kind of like if you're the type

849
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,620
of person who is less likely to
just remember to do it right or

850
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,630
like just follow your to do list.
If that's not you, then structuring

851
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:22,380
an environment where it's easier to
see the cues of your good habits,

852
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,640
less likely to see the distractions,
less friction between you and

853
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,000
the good behavior, more friction
between you and the bad ones.

854
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,240
If you place yourself in that space,
it's much more likely that

855
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,080
you're going to follow through.
So, you know, those are things that I

856
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:40,410
talk about in Chapter six and 12,
but I think that the book applies,

857
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,310
but I don't pitch it as like a
prescription for someone dealing with

858
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:48,030
a more serious issue. Totally. Yeah.
And I would say again,

859
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:52,470
I'm not an expert either, but as
someone who has been dealing with

860
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:58,940
depression the past couple of years.
Uh, having a professional that you go

861
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,260
to that deals with this stuff all the
time, like a therapist is so helpful.

862
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:09,860
And the therapist will be very
interested if you read James's book.

863
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,880
So I said to my therapist, I'm like,
you know, she starts way back here,

864
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:16,280
and then she says,
So what's new with you?

865
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,800
I'm like, Well, you know,
I read this book and I'm thinking,

866
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,430
Oh, what are you thinking about
doing with that?

867
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:24,030
Oh, I'm thinking about maybe
quitting alcohol.

868
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,200
Oh, well, that's, you know,
there's some reinforcement from

869
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,000
the professionals.
And likewise with my my doctor.

870
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,330
You know, when I when I had
depression and I went to my

871
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:42,500
physician, she said she gave me two
prescriptions, quit drinking alcohol.

872
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:50,240
And quit taking any kind of cannabis.
And the reason she says those

873
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,960
are going to make you feel bad.
Now, the trigger in that case

874
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,730
was my doctor.
It's nice when you have a doctor

875
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,220
saying, listen, this is your
prescription o and double the

876
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:03,210
amount of exercise I was doing.
So three things. Those.

877
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,320
So I did that for three months and
then I went back to my old habits.

878
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,890
But now I have that memory of what
it was like for three months,

879
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,840
and it's been a powerful trigger
for me to when I am starting to

880
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,350
notice my mood go down, I can.
I remembered, you know,

881
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:23,910
my doctor's prescription was quit
drinking, quit, you know, eating

882
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:28,560
edibles and doubling my exercise.
And that's been helpful for me

883
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,630
personally.
So I think if you're reading the

884
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:35,400
book, let your professional in
your life know about it is good.

885
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:40,710
And one thing I want you to do is
because I love the imagery, but and

886
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,100
this is probably unfair to you is
to give the ice cube example, but

887
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:52,200
use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.
So this is an example from the

888
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,910
first chapter of the book.
Um, and I actually as a side note,

889
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,200
I thought about this.
I was like, man,

890
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,510
we're gonna have to get these
change for the foreign editions.

891
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,980
Like we're gonna,
it's going to need to be.

892
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,880
But anyway, so. Yeah, yeah. The.
The core idea is that the process

893
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,000
of changing your habits is well,
it's similar to what we talked

894
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,820
about early on, that there's often
this valley of death, that there's

895
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,720
this period where you're just kind
of building up latent potential,

896
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,210
but you're not really releasing
any of the results yet.

897
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:24,200
And I like to equate it to the
process of heating up an ice cube,

898
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,330
you know,
so you've got you've got this ice

899
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:29,180
cube sitting on the table, right?
And so let's say it's like

900
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,560
negative three degrees in there,
right? So you're a negative three.

901
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,560
It's cold. You can see your breath.
The ice cube sitting there,

902
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,740
you heat it up negative two,
negative one. Still.

903
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,650
There's this ice cube sitting there.
Nothing has happened. Right?

904
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,630
Then you go from -1 to 0 and all of
a sudden you have this one degree

905
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:51,500
shift, no different than any of the
other shifts that came before it.

906
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,260
But you have this phase transition,
right?

907
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,190
And like the ice cube starts melting.
And that, I think,

908
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:01,520
is indicative of what it often
feels like to change a habit.

909
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,290
You're making these little
improvements.

910
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:07,280
You're trying to make these 1%
changes, these one degree shifts

911
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,750
each day, and you're like,
it's really easy to get frustrated

912
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,970
or even depressed at that point.
You know, it's like,

913
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,850
I've been running for three weeks.
How come I can't see a change in my

914
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,180
body, you know, Or I've been writing
blog posts for six months now.

915
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:24,860
How come this side isn't popular yet?
And the key point there is your

916
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,670
work was not being wasted.
It's just being stored. Yeah.

917
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,030
Complaining about sticking to a habit
for two months or three months or

918
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:35,300
even six months or a year, and not
having the outcome that you want

919
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,290
is kind of like complaining about
heating an ice cube from -3 to -1

920
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:41,900
degrees and it not melting yet. Yeah.
You know, like the,

921
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,600
the work was not wasted.
It's just being stored and I

922
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,320
love that quote.
That's in that same section from

923
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,740
Jacob Reese who it hangs in the
locker room of the San Antonio Spurs

924
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,080
who have won five NBA championships.
Yeah.

925
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,040
And it says essentially,
when I feel like giving up,

926
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,570
I think about the stonecutter who
continues to hammer away at the stone

927
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:07,160
100 times without it splitting.
And then finally on the 101st blow,

928
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,840
it cracks in two.
And I know that it wasn't the

929
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,920
100 that I know it wasn't the
101st swing that did it,

930
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,000
but the 100 that came before. Right.
And like it's that same idea.

931
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You know,
the reason the site takes off is not

932
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,360
because of the one viral article.
It's because of the 55 that you

933
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,740
wrote in the weeks and months prior.
The reason that you see a change in

934
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,490
your body is not because today's
workout radically transform you.

935
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,130
It's because you've been sticking
to it for eight months now.

936
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:37,460
Yeah,
and it's really about showing up.

937
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,150
Continue to put those swings in,
continue to raise the temperature by

938
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:44,900
one degree and eventually you hit
that phase transition where you can

939
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:49,760
see the results of your work. Yeah.
And that image has been so

940
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,740
powerful in my life.
The like I've been telling

941
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,100
people about this book and I
actually notice there's kind of

942
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,950
like a coffee shop test.
Like if I hear people talking about

943
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:05,420
something from Internet culture in
a coffee shop, like real people,

944
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,860
then something's hit and atomic
habits is like that.

945
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:17,330
Like it hit the the kind of
mainstream and that image of

946
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:20,870
just raising the temperature a
little bit every day.

947
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:28,490
Now I feel like I'm a few months
into this and I'm a little bit

948
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:34,340
kind of like evangelical about it.
Like I'm saying now, I'm like, God,

949
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,900
like my life is so much better.
And it's because of just these

950
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,680
little changes over time in the
same direction.

951
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,600
I can now I can see it now I can
see that I feel better, you know?

952
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,820
Wow, man, Quitting alcohol,
that was one thing.

953
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,640
And then, wow, showing up at the
gym 3 or 4 times a week.

954
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,370
That really helps.
And wow, like reading a real book

955
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:58,610
every night before I go to bed.
All of these things keep kind of

956
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:02,020
adding up.
And do make a meaningful

957
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,930
difference in your life,
even though way back when,

958
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:08,560
when you're starting, you feel like,
well, nothing's going to help me.

959
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:14,440
Now it's I want to be clear that
this these ideas have

960
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,670
meaningfully impacted my life.
So, yeah, I'm really thankful.

961
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,810
I'm thankful you wrote that book.
I'm thankful you you talked to

962
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,060
me in the airport.
It's been really great for me.

963
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,490
Oh, that's awesome.
Thank you so much for sharing that.

964
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:30,470
And ultimately, that's what the
whole thing is for, right?

965
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:33,460
I mean, it just it makes it feel
like it was worth the effort to

966
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,280
spend a few years writing it and
working on it. So that's great.

967
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:40,060
So before you go,
some people are asking like,

968
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:44,050
what recommendations for systems,
services, tools, trackers.

969
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,870
I know you have a new one coming out.
Do you want to talk about that?

970
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,210
Uh, sure. Yeah.
So got it right here next to me,

971
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,070
actually.
So this is the Habit Journal.

972
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:56,740
And we we just launched it two
weeks ago and it's got,

973
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,500
it's basically a doc grid notebook.
So if you're into bullet journaling

974
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,350
or you're into keeping a notebook
or use a notebook, the vast

975
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,530
majority of it are doc grid pages.
So you'll be able to use it like

976
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,930
any normal one.
But then at the back there's a

977
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:11,530
section with a habit tracker
templates, and I don't know if

978
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,570
you can see that very well,
but I've been using it.

979
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,370
For example,
this is this month so you can see

980
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:20,890
me tracking my habits on here.
Um, and so anyway, those templates

981
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,680
are in the back and they're also
perforated so you can tear them out

982
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,290
and put them on your desk or put
them on your kitchen counter or your

983
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,500
refrigerator or whatever. Yeah.
And then, and then at the very

984
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,370
beginning of the book there is a
section called One Line per Day.

985
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,670
So I've been using it for what
happened today.

986
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,370
And so I've been writing down
what happened each day.

987
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:43,300
And there are 31 lines,
so one for each day of the month

988
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,180
and there are 12 of them.
So by the time you get to the end

989
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,300
of the year, you should be able to
flip through and see, you know,

990
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,320
if you I'm doing what happened today.
Sean Blank does what's the

991
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,000
highlight of the day?
Yeah,

992
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,090
some other ones that I've seen are,
you know, what am I grateful for?

993
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:00,190
Or you could use it as like a
productivity thing.

994
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,650
You could say like,
what's my most important task today?

995
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,200
Things like that.
So there are a lot of examples.

996
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,470
In the back of the Notebook,
I have like 16 pages of examples

997
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:11,380
of how to use it.
But but anyway, it's called the

998
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,230
Habit Journal and yeah,
I'm excited about it.

999
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:16,930
Think it'll be a good tool to
help people build better habits.

1000
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,750
And a lot of folks I've heard
from a lot of folks that really

1001
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,180
like the audiobook.
So if you folks aren't readers,

1002
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,380
go check out the audiobook.
People like us read Atomic Habits.

1003
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:32,140
So thanks again for your time,
James. Really appreciate it, man.

1004
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:33,490
Awesome. Thank you.

1005
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,460
There you go.
Hope that was helpful for you.

1006
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,310
Like I said, I really recommend
the book Atomic Habits.

1007
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,740
That journal that he's talking
about is also available there.

1008
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:03,360
Folks, it's 2019 and if you are
tired of bootstrapping alone, I've

1009
