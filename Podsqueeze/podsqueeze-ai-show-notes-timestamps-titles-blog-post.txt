Building an Audience: Insights from Justin Jackson, Co-founder of Transistor

Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to share with you the insights from our recent podcast episode where we had the pleasure of hosting Justin Jackson, co-founder of Transistor and founder of Mega Maker. We've been fans of each other's podcasts for a while, so it was exciting to finally have a conversation.

The Importance of Audience Building

Our conversation kicked off with a deep dive into the topic of audience building and the significance of starting with a market instead of an idea. Justin shared that he draws inspiration for new ideas from his interactions within the Mega Maker community, as well as from podcasts and books. He emphasized that as long as he continues to engage with people and explore new ideas, he never runs out of things to talk about.

Defining a Good Audience

When asked about what makes a good audience and whether it's necessary to be part of the audience, Justin explained that he has shifted his perspective on this. He now believes that the market is the most important factor when starting a business. He defines a market as a group of people who buy or engage in a particular activity.

To illustrate this, he gave the example of Taylor Otwell, the founder of Laravel, who has a large audience on Twitter but is part of a much bigger market of PHP programmers. Justin emphasized the importance of understanding the size and economic activity within a market when building an audience.

The Success of Laravel

We discussed the success of Laravel, a PHP framework created by Taylor Otwell. We were amazed that Taylor, as a solo developer, has sold $10 million worth of software to PHP developers. However, we also noted that there are still other frameworks and programmers who are not familiar with Laravel, leaving room for further growth.

The Role of Market Demand

Justin stressed the importance of finding a market with demonstrated demand. He explained that having a demonstrated demand in a market is crucial and emphasized the significance of connecting with people in that market and building relationships.

We also discussed our initial focus on building an audience for our podcast but have since shifted our perspective. We referred to a tweet from Jane Portman and Rob Walling, who also believe that having an audience may not always be necessary for success.

The Challenges of Starting a Business

Justin acknowledged the challenges and uncertainties that come with starting a business. He emphasized the importance of optimism and perseverance and advised aspiring entrepreneurs to explore different markets and step out of their comfort zones to discover new opportunities.

The Journey of Entrepreneurship with a Spouse or Family

We also touched on the topic of how to approach the journey of entrepreneurship with a spouse or family. Justin shared his personal experience of starting retail shops in his early 20s, which resulted in financial losses for his family. He advised against overworking oneself and wasting cycles on unproductive efforts.

Climbing Ladders in Terms of Earning Potential

Justin introduced the concept of climbing ladders in terms of earning potential. He explained that each ladder represents a different level of difficulty and income potential. As you move up the ladder, the difficulty increases, but so does the potential for higher income.

The Role of Luck in Success

When asked about the role of luck in their success, Justin emphasized the importance of attitude and continuously trying new things. He believes that while luck plays a part, most of the influence of luck diminishes after factors like where you were born and your parents.

In conclusion, our conversation with Justin was filled with valuable insights and lessons. It was a reminder of the importance of understanding your market, building relationships, and continuously exploring new opportunities. Whether you're an aspiring entrepreneur or an established business owner, I hope you find these insights as valuable as we did.
