--------- HIGHLIGHTS WITH TRANSCRIPT ---------

* Converting Heights and Measurement Systems | 0:01:52 - 0:03:13 (81 Seconds)

0:01:52 Speaker 3
Yeah, If I had to guess, I'd guess that Noah is about six feet tall and I'm going to guess Ben is about the same height as me. I'm five foot eight. How did I?  

0:02:06 Speaker 1
do so. You're pretty good. I'm six foot three, okay.  

0:02:11 Speaker 2
And I'm trying to calculate centimeters to foot rent.  

0:02:14 Speaker 3
Oh yeah, See, this is the weird Canadian thing is that we use the metric system, but we are so close to the US that we end up doing measurements in inches, so I'm almost exactly six foot tall. Oh, you're almost exactly six feet. Okay See, now everybody knows, everybody's just adjusted.  

0:02:38 Speaker 2
Maybe you should just attach images to the show notes.  

0:02:41 Speaker 3
So what is it? I think every podcast show notes needs to have stats on people Noah six foot three Ben how many centimeters.  

0:02:51 Speaker 2
Is that it's 185 or 186.  

0:02:55 Speaker 3
185 centimeters.  

0:02:56 Speaker 1
Yeah, give people some stats, that's what they want to hear Blue eyes, dark blondish, pretty blonde hair Form a picture. So yeah, so we're glad to have you on the show, Justin.  

----------------------------------------------

* The Challenges of Publishing Regularly | 0:05:09 - 0:07:11 (122 Seconds)

0:05:09 Speaker 3
I do have moments like John and I are doing our podcast now and I think we're ready for the year to be done in some ways, you know, like ready for things to kind of wind down, and so I think there's such thing as fatigue when you're publishing something every week and you eventually need to give your brain space to just explore. You know other things and have other ideas, but yeah, not most of the time. As long as I'm interacting with people and real life situations and also doing experiments in my own life, I don't have anything to say yet.  

0:05:51 Speaker 1
Yeah, I could see the fatigue in that, like you feel like you're you have to have something to say, like at least every week when you have the podcast, like you have to have a new thing that you're thinking about or that you can dive into. Yeah, we definitely kind of see that.  

0:06:06 Speaker 3
I think this is what that's why breaks are important. I Almost get this more with, because podcasting you can just turn on the mics and if you have a rough idea of where you want to go, you can talk it out. But writing, I find, is a lot more, takes a lot more of my energy and so, like writing that weekly newsletter that I write is there are definitely weeks where that is time I Not because I don't have an idea, but sometimes to process ideas and actually Write it in a way that makes sense as hard. But yeah, the in either case, breaks are good.  

0:06:48 Speaker 2
I can't always say I'm receiving that newsletter and you're doing pretty good, I guess I'm enjoying it.  

0:06:56 Speaker 3
I don't. That almost gives me more pressure, because then I'm like oh, I like it, I got to keep going.  

0:07:01 Speaker 2
Yeah, well, and that came down now. In that case, I hated it. So we got a.  

----------------------------------------------

* The Economic Impact of PHP Programmers | 0:09:18 - 0:10:45 (87 Seconds)

0:09:18 Speaker 3
It's hard to count the number of programmers in the world, but let's just say a reasonable estimate is that there's five million PHP programmers in the world.  

0:09:27 Speaker 2
Mm-hmm. Would you agree with that, Ben yeah, definitely you know I've actually used Laravel for a couple of projects.  

0:09:35 Speaker 3
Okay there you go, and so, and Five million PHP programmers in the world and. Let's just say, let's just take one element of that market, not including all the tools they buy, not including, you know, everything else that you need to be a programmer. Let's just think about salary, and these are. These are just guesses, but let's say, on average, an Average PHP programmer in the world makes twenty five thousand dollars a year. Well, twenty five thousand times five million is 125 billion. I think that's a hundred and twenty five billion dollars being spent on salaries for PHP developers alone. That's a massive Market. It's not just a big group of people, but it's also a big group of people who where there's some sort of economic activity being generated, and I think it's why products in the Laravel community often have a magnified Impact compared to other things.  

----------------------------------------------

* Targeting a Larger Market Is Important | 0:20:32 - 0:22:06 (94 Seconds)

0:20:32 Speaker 3
Some public disagreements with people who could be right. I mean, these are my friends and people I respect, but the idea of going after a small niche, I think and again, maybe people are, I don't know. The idea of going after a small niche is just, you're limiting yourself to, let's say, a pool of 5,000, 10,000 people. Well, that's like going to a little tiny stream and trying to like scoop up a little bit of water from a tiny stream, as opposed to going after a big, massive market in motion. That's like going to a rushing river and just putting your cup in the river and just like scooping out a little, and sure, you might be able to fill up your cup just at a small little stream. But the rushing river has so much water that it's a lot easier for a solo bootstrapper to just put their cup in the river and then scoop up a bunch of water. And I think sometimes this idea of niche leads people to the wrong places. They're just looking for these tiny streams that no one else has ever discovered before and they say, well, we've got to avoid the big rivers because everyone knows about those. Yeah, but it's a lot easier to get your cup in a big river and scoop out some water than find this tiny little thing that nobody knows exists.  

0:22:02 Speaker 2
Yeah, in the end your cup is bigger than the river.  

0:22:06 Speaker 3
Exactly.  

----------------------------------------------

* Market Demand and PayPal's Success | 0:24:41 - 0:25:52 (71 Seconds)

0:24:41 Speaker 3
But, I think that, unfortunately, that's exactly what I do want to do is I want to say is there any evidence in this market of prior demonstrated demand? That's just a great word from Corey Gwynne. And so PayPal let's take PayPal as an example. What was the market for what PayPal was doing before PayPal existed? What was massive? The Western Union like money transfer market people trying to pay for things with credit cards online but having to go through their credit card processors, and there's all sorts of friction. But there's tons of evidence that there was billions of dollars being spent in that market already, and so it's not like PayPal invented anything. I mean, sure, they created a new way of doing those things, but they didn't create the market. They were riding a wave that already existed. They just saw the wave coming and they built a better surfboard that enabled them to ride further than anyone else had at the time.  

----------------------------------------------

* The Journey of Entrepreneurship | 0:36:56 - 0:38:46 (110 Seconds)

0:36:56 Speaker 3
My friend, nathan Berry, is not even 30 yet and has already achieved more as a founder than a lot of folks. But I think you have to have this idea of well, it might not happen, but I'm going to try, and this might be a 10 year project or this might be a 20 year project and you almost have to be okay with that. Like this just might take time for everything to align and the whole time I'm going to have to be working as if this will eventually work out and not just doing the same thing, putting yourself in new circles, getting outside of your comfort zone. I've described this before as is it command and conquer that uses fog of war, where you're just on a map and everything's dark and you're exploring it. Yeah, so if you think about that as a metaphor like when you start out you're just in that map and all you can see is around you right, and as you explore more of the map, more and more parts become illuminated and every once in a while you'll end up in a spot of the map where things just happen right, like you get a bunch of bounty or you run into a bunch of enemies or whatever, and it's kind of like that, like you're walking around. For me, for example, I was walking around and I just happened to run into Adam Wathen, who I had no idea who he was or anything about him, but he ended up being quite an influential person in the Laravel community. And that was just me wandering around the map and him wandering around the map too and then Meeting each other and once once I could see like I've learned tons about.  

----------------------------------------------

* Entrepreneurship Realities and Long Journeys | 0:41:32 - 0:43:11 (99 Seconds)

0:41:32 Speaker 3
So this podcast has to be title unpopular opinion Jackson jakes, I mean it's just like, if you want the reality, the reality is not good statistically. I mean, clearly, I think I Think all entrepreneurs have this feeling that maybe they can do it better than the next guy and Because, statistically, you know, millions of people start businesses but those people are in all sorts of different places, have all sorts of different leverage, have all sorts of different privilege. You know there's there's all these factors that go into, you know, why a person becomes a success or not, and I think every entrepreneur feels like they've got some secret sauce that'll make them better than the next guy. Oh, yeah but I mean, in my early 20s I started a couple retail shops that ended up losing a lot of money and that was hard to recover from as a family, and so that that is just part of it, like, if you're gonna be on that, so that was almost 20 years ago and yeah, so now I'm at a place where, you know, maybe I've learned enough lessons, that I've made enough connections, that I've made enough connections that things are happening. But that's a long journey. That's 10, 20 years of Work and so, yeah, I mean I think that's something you got to consider with, kind of, with everything.  

----------------------------------------------

* The Role of Privilege in Business | 0:47:14 - 0:48:04 (49 Seconds)

0:47:14 Speaker 3
But yeah, for for John it's easy. He's got no dependence and His cost of living is low and he had a bunch of money saved up For him. Yeah, this isn't that's easy.  

0:47:26 Speaker 2
This isn't make it or break it. It's like no, I can just, if this doesn't work.  

0:47:29 Speaker 3
Yeah, I'm fine, so that if you want to make it easier, I think, lower your expenses and Save a bunch of money, or get someone to give you a bunch of money.  

0:47:46 Speaker 1
Or rob a bank or whatever, I go the easy route. I mean, this is why privilege plays such a big role in this.  

0:47:51 Speaker 3
I mean, this is why privilege plays such a big part in business. Like some people do, they get a, they have a big trust fund and they get a bunch of money. It does help.  

0:48:01 Speaker 2
Yeah, I agree yeah.  

0:48:03 Speaker 1
Yeah, that makes sense.
