0:00:03,026 --> 0:00:04,048
Speaker 3: This is Transistorfm.

2
0:00:15,413 --> 0:00:39,069
Speaker 2: Hey, product People, justin Jackson here, and I've got a brand new interview for you with James Clear, who is the author of Atomic Habits, a book that has really changed my life since I've read it, and I don't want to give too much of an intro, I just want to get right into the actual interview.

3
0:00:39,840 --> 0:00:48,510
Speaker 2: If you like this, please reach out to James on Twitter, at James Clear, and if you have comments about the episode, reach out to me on Twitter.

4
0:00:48,620 --> 0:00:52,310
Speaker 2: I'm the letter M, the letter I, justin M, I, justin.

5
0:00:53,200 --> 0:01:01,642
Speaker 2: Here is me and James talking about habits and how you can make your life better one day at a time.

6
0:01:09,220 --> 0:01:10,626
Speaker 2: The book, your book's been out for a while.

7
0:01:10,800 --> 0:01:16,207
Speaker 2: It's right here Atomic Habits, if you see it in an airport or something near you.

8
0:01:16,688 --> 0:01:17,570
Speaker 2: How long has it been out now?

9
0:01:19,620 --> 0:01:21,606
Speaker 3: Today is 100 days exactly.

10
0:01:21,827 --> 0:01:22,148
Speaker 2: No way.

11
0:01:23,562 --> 0:01:24,926
Speaker 3: Yeah, so just over three months.

12
0:01:26,260 --> 0:01:43,450
Speaker 2: I'm curious, because now it's been out for a while Is there one idea that you see that people keep sharing, like one idea that resonated from the book in particular, that gets shared more than anything else on Twitter or whatever?

13
0:01:44,920 --> 0:01:56,727
Speaker 3: So I was curious about that myself when I was writing the book and thinking about it, because I kind of felt like, all right, hopefully all these ideas are useful, but what's the one thing that people are going to latch on to?

14
0:01:56,960 --> 0:02:03,887
Speaker 3: Because sometimes you'll hear that from authors that there was one chapter or something that was the chapter that really stuck with people.

15
0:02:05,660 --> 0:02:12,434
Speaker 3: I'm grateful for the fact that there are a variety of things, but there are a few things.

16
0:02:12,680 --> 0:02:28,283
Speaker 3: So the first one is identity-based habits, which is chapter two, and that concept really seems to have resonated with people, the idea of trying to reinforce your desired identity and kind of starting with who you want to become rather than what you want to achieve.

17
0:02:29,901 --> 0:02:36,164
Speaker 3: And I'm glad that it did, because that was the chapter I debated over the most of where to put it in the book.

18
0:02:36,561 --> 0:02:38,488
Speaker 3: I had it at different points.

19
0:02:38,600 --> 0:02:42,446
Speaker 3: It was the first chapter, it was the last chapter, it ended up being the second one.

20
0:02:42,720 --> 0:02:49,028
Speaker 3: I also had this thought in my head that it should be about midway through the book, so it really jumped all over the place.

21
0:02:49,168 --> 0:02:52,684
Speaker 3: But I ended up thinking I feel like this is one of the best ideas.

22
0:02:52,865 --> 0:03:01,508
Speaker 3: So I want to have it early, so that people, even if they don't finish the book, they still come across this idea, and I'm glad that that ended up working out well.

23
0:03:02,940 --> 0:03:11,490
Speaker 3: The other one that people bring up a lot is the two-minute rule and the idea of scaling your habits down to the point where they take two minutes or less.

24
0:03:12,081 --> 0:03:14,108
Speaker 3: I think that that's a very actionable one.

25
0:03:14,600 --> 0:03:16,287
Speaker 3: It's like, okay, I know exactly what to do.

26
0:03:16,400 --> 0:03:19,890
Speaker 3: I wanted to do a workout, but now I'll just focus on doing five push-ups.

27
0:03:20,160 --> 0:03:26,553
Speaker 3: Or I wanted to read 30 books this year and now I'll focus on reading one page a day or something like that Got you.

28
0:03:27,080 --> 0:03:30,129
Speaker 3: So I think the actionableness of that one also tends to stick.

29
0:03:30,840 --> 0:03:42,869
Speaker 2: And so, going back to the identity, one is this the idea that every action you take or every habit you develop is a vote for the person you want to become.

30
0:03:43,871 --> 0:03:44,092
Speaker 3: Right.

31
0:03:44,520 --> 0:04:05,053
Speaker 3: So that's kind of like my core philosophy behind it, this idea that the way that we develop beliefs about ourselves, that we reinforce our self-image, that we develop our identity to a certain degree is largely reinforced by the experiences and behaviors that we perform over time.

32
0:04:05,760 --> 0:04:15,972
Speaker 3: So some aspects of your identity are relatively fixed, like, for example, if you're tall or short, but even that idea that I am tall or I am short, that's reinforced.

33
0:04:16,080 --> 0:04:18,147
Speaker 3: You learn that through experiences in life.

34
0:04:19,420 --> 0:04:26,647
Speaker 3: Now there are many aspects of your identity that are less fixed than that but are still reinforced by your experiences.

35
0:04:29,845 --> 0:04:35,494
Speaker 3: So if you write one sentence today, you probably don't think about yourself as I am a writer.

36
0:04:35,920 --> 0:04:43,649
Speaker 3: But if you do that every day for six months or nine months or a year, at some point you turn around and you think, huh, maybe I am the kind of person who is a writer.

37
0:04:45,665 --> 0:04:53,444
Speaker 3: Or if you study biology every Tuesday night for 20 minutes, you at some point think I guess I'm studious, I keep doing this every week.

38
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:55,105
Speaker 3: Maybe this is the kind of person I am.

39
0:04:55,760 --> 0:05:15,369
Speaker 3: And so I like that idea that our habits are like votes for the type of person we believe that we are, that they build up evidence of looking at ourselves in a certain way, and I like to phrase it that way, not only because I believe that it's true, but also beliefs and behavior are kind of a two-way street.

40
0:05:16,581 --> 0:05:23,907
Speaker 3: So you'll hear people say things like well, just be positive, or just believe in yourself, or fake it till you make it, or things like that.

41
0:05:24,960 --> 0:05:28,891
Speaker 3: And there's nothing necessarily wrong with fake it till you make it.

42
0:05:29,361 --> 0:05:41,090
Speaker 3: It's fine to be positive and believe things about yourself, but it's a very short-term strategy, because fake it till you make it is asking you to believe something about yourself without having evidence for it.

43
0:05:41,560 --> 0:05:49,462
Speaker 3: It's like that kind of visualization stuff or mantra stuff where you look at yourself in the mirror and you tell yourself I am a writer, I am a writer even though you haven't written yet.

44
0:05:50,760 --> 0:05:59,209
Speaker 3: And so what I'm saying is similar but, I think, importantly different, in the sense that you let the behavior lead the way rather than the belief.

45
0:05:59,680 --> 0:06:16,870
Speaker 3: And I think that's the best lever we have for changing the way that we look at ourselves, which is to say, show up and write a sentence every day, and soon you're going to have something to root that new identity of I am a writer in, and it's a much more, I think, robust and long-term way of changing how you look at yourself.

46
0:06:17,520 --> 0:06:26,553
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think for me the, because you first communicated that idea to me in an airport in Denver.

47
0:06:27,744 --> 0:06:28,506
Speaker 3: Yeah, I remember that.

48
0:06:30,202 --> 0:06:38,861
Speaker 2: And at the time in my life I was not doing so good, I was depressed, I was, I think, cynical, especially.

49
0:06:38,882 --> 0:06:59,330
Speaker 2: I think cynical about people like you that seem to have it all together, that seem to be really like doing all the good habits, and when you're not doing so good, looking at someone that seems to have it all together just can make you more grumpy or more cynical or more whatever.

50
0:07:00,520 --> 0:07:18,171
Speaker 2: But I remember you sitting down and kind of hashing this out with me and that idea of Justin, no matter where you're at right now and no matter what you've done, you could start today with one action.

51
0:07:20,523 --> 0:07:25,015
Speaker 2: So if you go running today, that might not make a big difference.

52
0:07:25,035 --> 0:07:37,380
Speaker 2: But then, if you do it tomorrow and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day, at the end of the week you might say, well, wait a second, I think I'm a runner, right.

53
0:07:38,673 --> 0:07:50,793
Speaker 2: And maybe after a couple of weeks you might say, well, I'm going to get myself some runner clothes and go and get some runner clothes, and then I'm going to get myself a good pair of shoot, I'm going to install that Strava app and all of a sudden you could see yourself.

54
0:07:50,873 --> 0:07:55,343
Speaker 2: That was a really hopeful message for me.

55
0:07:55,523 --> 0:08:08,698
Speaker 2: When I was really struggling to figure out it was way easier for me to be cynical and just kind of look back at all these people implementing good, healthy processes and say, well, that's not for me, that's just for people that, whatever you know.

56
0:08:09,550 --> 0:08:22,042
Speaker 2: But seeing, hearing that gave me hope to think you know, I could do that I could, and it's surprising how little time it takes to, you know, accomplish that.

57
0:08:23,250 --> 0:08:24,032
Speaker 2: Is that something?

58
0:08:25,115 --> 0:08:28,282
Speaker 2: Have other people been kind of referencing that too?

59
0:08:28,470 --> 0:08:30,237
Speaker 2: Is that part of the?

60
0:08:31,160 --> 0:08:35,316
Speaker 2: And maybe that's what's so good about having it as chapter two, because it gives me some hope, right.

61
0:08:35,990 --> 0:08:41,662
Speaker 3: Well, what's interesting is that that process of changing in that way it's happening anyway, you know.

62
0:08:42,570 --> 0:08:43,717
Speaker 3: So I think back to like the beginning.

63
0:08:43,757 --> 0:08:50,301
Speaker 3: Like, for example, if I think of the early days of my entrepreneurial career, well, I didn't have any entrepreneurs in my family.

64
0:08:50,582 --> 0:08:52,599
Speaker 3: I didn't have any close friends who were entrepreneurs.

65
0:08:52,961 --> 0:08:59,250
Speaker 3: There was no reason for me to think that's who I am or to feel like I was externally validated with, like that was part of my identity.

66
0:08:59,712 --> 0:09:12,518
Speaker 3: I had no evidence of it, and so early on I just all I had was hope, right, the hope that, oh, maybe I'll be able to build something, maybe I'll be able to make this work, yeah, so I went to go up and for me it was probably about two years in.

67
0:09:12,698 --> 0:09:20,055
Speaker 3: It's probably about where I kind of like the scale tipped and I started to think I am an entrepreneur, like that's part of who I am.

68
0:09:20,630 --> 0:09:26,062
Speaker 3: But it really took proving it to myself that I can pay my bills through this.

69
0:09:26,303 --> 0:09:30,220
Speaker 3: You know that I can like actually have a lifestyle and a career in this way.

70
0:09:30,530 --> 0:09:35,753
Speaker 3: I had to prove it for about two years before I really started to latch onto it and say this is who I am.

71
0:09:35,913 --> 0:09:36,535
Speaker 3: Yeah.

72
0:09:39,212 --> 0:09:41,579
Speaker 3: So my point is, that's always happening.

73
0:09:43,212 --> 0:10:07,899
Speaker 3: You're continually updating your beliefs about yourself based on the experiences that you're going through, and all I'm talking about is simply designing that process in a little more careful or thoughtful way, rather than just kind of letting it happen to you and be like well, I guess I'll figure out who I am based on what life throws at me versus how about I figure out who I am based on the votes that I cast each day and what I decide to, what habits I decide to follow?

74
0:10:08,059 --> 0:10:10,311
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah Again.

75
0:10:10,331 --> 0:10:15,194
Speaker 2: Like that is a very hopeful message for someone who's just kind of sitting back and waiting for it to happen.

76
0:10:16,990 --> 0:10:23,583
Speaker 2: What sustains you when you're in the process but not there yet.

77
0:10:25,312 --> 0:10:28,519
Speaker 2: Like you mentioned, entrepreneur, and you're like man, it took a long time.

78
0:10:29,160 --> 0:10:30,383
Speaker 3: Yeah, what sustains you.

79
0:10:31,030 --> 0:10:41,444
Speaker 3: It's a really good question because I think a lot of habits you know, entrepreneurship is certainly this way, exercise is this way where the rewards of a habit are often very delayed.

80
0:10:42,411 --> 0:10:46,101
Speaker 3: You know, like what's the reward for working out for like three weeks?

81
0:10:46,631 --> 0:10:47,755
Speaker 3: Like not really a whole lot.

82
0:10:47,856 --> 0:10:49,816
Speaker 3: Honestly, your body hasn't really changed.

83
0:10:50,010 --> 0:10:51,756
Speaker 3: The scale is probably about the same.

84
0:10:52,870 --> 0:10:53,894
Speaker 3: You're probably just sore.

85
0:10:54,114 --> 0:10:57,638
Speaker 3: You know, yeah, Like there probably isn't like a whole lot to show for it.

86
0:10:57,670 --> 0:11:06,281
Speaker 3: It's really not unless you stick with that habit for three months or six months or a year that you actually start to see the changes you were hoping to get when you set out.

87
0:11:07,030 --> 0:11:14,118
Speaker 3: And so there's kind of this like valley of death in the beginning where in a way, it's sort of like gets harder before it gets easier.

88
0:11:14,350 --> 0:11:21,234
Speaker 3: You know it feels uncomfortable, you feel sore and pain, you feel uncertain when you walk in the gym you feel like people are judging you.

89
0:11:22,110 --> 0:11:26,098
Speaker 3: Same way with starting a business, you know, in a weird way it's kind of harder before it gets easier.

90
0:11:26,230 --> 0:11:28,017
Speaker 3: You start out but you're not making any money.

91
0:11:28,510 --> 0:11:36,540
Speaker 3: You feel stupid a lot of the time because you don't know how to make a sales call or what customers are looking for or whether you're even offering the right product.

92
0:11:37,570 --> 0:11:43,397
Speaker 3: I remember when I first started I like I said I didn't know anybody, didn't have any entrepreneurs in my family.

93
0:11:43,550 --> 0:11:45,076
Speaker 3: So I was like, well, I need to get to know some people.

94
0:11:45,590 --> 0:11:50,734
Speaker 3: So I sent a bunch of emails to reach out and just ask if people would chat on Skype for like 30 minutes or whatever.

95
0:11:51,710 --> 0:11:57,908
Speaker 3: And I remember sending those first few and thinking is this even, do people even do this Do people chat on Skype with people that they haven't met before?

96
0:11:58,110 --> 0:11:59,556
Speaker 3: Like, is this a weird thing to ask?

97
0:11:59,990 --> 0:12:02,097
Speaker 3: There's just a lot of that uncertainty early on.

98
0:12:02,790 --> 0:12:07,541
Speaker 3: So your point is, I think, a valid one, which is well, what do you do to get through that?

99
0:12:08,751 --> 0:12:13,502
Speaker 3: How do you kind of get through that valley of death while you're waiting for the long-term rewards to accumulate?

100
0:12:13,642 --> 0:12:13,882
Speaker 3: Yeah.

101
0:12:14,350 --> 0:12:20,242
Speaker 3: And I think that this is where psychologists call it reinforcement or an external reinforcer.

102
0:12:21,512 --> 0:12:27,315
Speaker 3: But you want some kind of reinforcement that is enjoyable in the moment, so that you have a reason to keep showing up.

103
0:12:29,034 --> 0:12:30,940
Speaker 3: So they're kind of from a habit standpoint.

104
0:12:31,070 --> 0:12:32,335
Speaker 3: There are kind of two ways to do this.

105
0:12:33,490 --> 0:12:38,021
Speaker 3: First thing is just a strategic choice about what type of habit you choose to follow.

106
0:12:38,450 --> 0:12:43,982
Speaker 3: So if we go back to the exercise example, well, not everybody has to work out like a bodybuilder.

107
0:12:44,490 --> 0:12:50,763
Speaker 3: You could do Pilates or yoga or go for a run or rock climbing or all kinds of stuff.

108
0:12:51,350 --> 0:12:57,142
Speaker 3: And so pick the form of a habit that brings you the most joy, that is most enjoyable to you.

109
0:12:58,150 --> 0:13:02,105
Speaker 3: It's going to be a slog, for you know, you're going to have to swim for months to see a change in your body.

110
0:13:02,125 --> 0:13:03,310
Speaker 3: You're going to have to cycle for months.

111
0:13:03,310 --> 0:13:04,696
Speaker 3: You're going to have to lift weights for months.

112
0:13:05,230 --> 0:13:06,656
Speaker 3: It doesn't really matter which one you choose.

113
0:13:06,870 --> 0:13:07,593
Speaker 3: It's going to take a while.

114
0:13:08,150 --> 0:13:11,498
Speaker 3: So you might as well choose the one that's most exciting or enjoyable to you.

115
0:13:13,410 --> 0:13:15,356
Speaker 3: Same way with, like, imagine a reading habit.

116
0:13:15,637 --> 0:13:17,001
Speaker 3: You don't have to read.

117
0:13:17,110 --> 0:13:19,979
Speaker 3: You might feel like, oh, I have a business, so I need to read business books.

118
0:13:20,590 --> 0:13:25,396
Speaker 3: But really, ultimately the most important thing is do you get in the habit of reading, do you fall in love with reading?

119
0:13:25,830 --> 0:13:39,859
Speaker 3: So if you need to start with sci-fi books or fantasy or something like that, well, start with that, you know, like do the one that is intrinsically valuable to you at first, and once the habit is built then you can transition to some of the other stuff.

120
0:13:40,990 --> 0:13:44,119
Speaker 3: So that's one method for kind of getting through that valley of death.

121
0:13:44,259 --> 0:13:54,712
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I think this brings up maybe a harder question, which is so, you know, based on your book.

122
0:13:56,338 --> 0:14:00,394
Speaker 2: It's January and I'm thinking okay, you know, I haven't been in the gym for seven years.

123
0:14:01,313 --> 0:14:02,337
Speaker 2: I used to love working out.

124
0:14:02,630 --> 0:14:03,173
Speaker 2: I'm going to go.

125
0:14:04,270 --> 0:14:06,237
Speaker 2: I got my streaks app on my phone.

126
0:14:06,990 --> 0:14:07,432
Speaker 2: Start going.

127
0:14:09,573 --> 0:14:11,199
Speaker 2: And I've probably been, I don't know.

128
0:14:11,439 --> 0:14:15,514
Speaker 2: I've probably been at least 18 days or maybe even 20 days this month.

129
0:14:16,457 --> 0:14:17,199
Speaker 2: So it's great.

130
0:14:17,911 --> 0:14:22,082
Speaker 2: And I was surprised by how fast I felt.

131
0:14:22,230 --> 0:14:24,096
Speaker 2: So the first day I felt like I didn't belong.

132
0:14:24,538 --> 0:14:25,340
Speaker 2: I felt awkward.

133
0:14:25,370 --> 0:14:26,253
Speaker 2: I don't know anybody here.

134
0:14:26,293 --> 0:14:28,852
Speaker 2: I'm walking in Some of the machinery.

135
0:14:29,615 --> 0:14:31,100
Speaker 2: I recognize, some I don't.

136
0:14:31,170 --> 0:14:34,881
Speaker 2: I have to, like you know, find, get back into a routine.

137
0:14:34,970 --> 0:14:37,057
Speaker 2: I have to find which exercise I'm going to do.

138
0:14:38,190 --> 0:14:41,078
Speaker 2: There's all these kind of insecurities and questions.

139
0:14:42,710 --> 0:14:46,540
Speaker 2: But after a week I kind of felt like I belonged.

140
0:14:47,510 --> 0:14:51,519
Speaker 2: But I wonder if that's because it was easier for me.

141
0:14:52,241 --> 0:14:54,072
Speaker 2: You know I had this.

142
0:14:54,252 --> 0:14:58,641
Speaker 2: You know I'm I'm relatively, I was already relatively in shape.

143
0:15:00,230 --> 0:15:07,598
Speaker 2: So there's a big difference between going in, where you feel like, oh, maybe I'm a few pounds overweight, and going in and being 200 pounds overweight.

144
0:15:08,110 --> 0:15:13,721
Speaker 2: There's a big difference between, you know, going in, even as a white male.

145
0:15:13,982 --> 0:15:16,618
Speaker 2: Compared to you know, there's a big difference.

146
0:15:16,698 --> 0:15:24,194
Speaker 2: Going in and feeling like, well, I've done these exercises before, so I'm not completely out of my element and I'm wondering how.

147
0:15:27,423 --> 0:15:35,064
Speaker 2: I mean, are our habits like that achievable because of privilege and context and other things Like?

148
0:15:35,084 --> 0:15:36,640
Speaker 2: How much does that play into it?

149
0:15:36,680 --> 0:15:47,430
Speaker 2: And you know, if someone is walking in and there are 200 pounds overweight, do they still have the same chance of progress and success?

150
0:15:47,660 --> 0:15:50,827
Speaker 2: It just feels like such a big mountain for them to go over.

151
0:15:51,529 --> 0:15:51,930
Speaker 3: For sure.

152
0:15:52,671 --> 0:16:19,728
Speaker 3: Yeah, so this is one reason why I think starting with small habits is so incredibly important, because a lot of the time when we think about the outcome that you want so just to continue your weight loss or exercise example, everybody gets wrapped up and like, oh, I want to lose 100 pounds, or I want to lose 20 pounds or whatever the number is, but you forget about there, like all these little logistical and emotional details that come along with starting a new habit.

153
0:16:20,380 --> 0:16:22,391
Speaker 3: So you know I'll often tell the story about.

154
0:16:22,411 --> 0:16:30,466
Speaker 3: I have this reader who he ended up losing over 100 pounds and one of the first things he did was he went to the gym but he wasn't allowed to stay for longer than five minutes.

155
0:16:31,421 --> 0:16:36,021
Speaker 3: So, he drove to the gym, got out of the car, did half an exercise, got back in the car, drove home.

156
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:38,567
Speaker 3: And it sounds ridiculous to people.

157
0:16:38,820 --> 0:16:44,132
Speaker 3: It sounds silly because it's like, well, clearly, exercising for five minutes is not going to get you in shape I guess not.

158
0:16:44,900 --> 0:16:48,811
Speaker 3: But what you realize is he was mastering the art of showing up right.

159
0:16:48,900 --> 0:16:54,745
Speaker 3: He was becoming the type of person that drove to the gym every day and when you're in that state, right.

160
0:16:54,765 --> 0:17:08,690
Speaker 3: For him, at that point, that was the biggest shift was can I just become the type of person who gets in here right, who overcomes the uncertainty or feeling uncomfortable or feeling judged, and all those things are very real hurdles to building a habit.

161
0:17:08,900 --> 0:17:15,187
Speaker 3: You know, like there's, there are all these little questions that need to be answered for something like that, like, okay, I want to go to the gym.

162
0:17:15,580 --> 0:17:17,267
Speaker 3: Well, what time am I going to go?

163
0:17:17,400 --> 0:17:18,966
Speaker 3: Am I going to go before work or after work?

164
0:17:19,620 --> 0:17:20,504
Speaker 3: What gym will I go to?

165
0:17:21,240 --> 0:17:22,586
Speaker 3: What route am I going to take to get there?

166
0:17:23,180 --> 0:17:26,569
Speaker 3: Do I need to bring a water bottle, or is there like a water fountain at the gym?

167
0:17:27,780 --> 0:17:33,403
Speaker 3: And all those little questions like that, like you know, whether or not you, there's a water fountain at the gym.

168
0:17:33,463 --> 0:17:34,266
Speaker 3: It sounds small.

169
0:17:34,860 --> 0:17:45,268
Speaker 3: But if you already feel uncomfortable and feel like you don't belong and then you always forget to bring your water bottle and you're like, oh, there's nothing ever and there's never anything to drink there, that's enough friction to get you to quit in the beginning.

170
0:17:45,780 --> 0:18:10,749
Speaker 3: So starting with something simple, like all I'm going to do is I'm going to show up and I'm going to do one exercise for five minutes and then I'm going to go, that, I think, is a good way to start, and it reminds me of what Steven Pressfield wrote I think it was in the War of Art where he said something to the effect of like, if you sit down each day at the computer and you do your writing at some point, at first it feels uncomfortable, but at some point that becomes your territory.

171
0:18:11,420 --> 0:18:24,245
Speaker 3: And I really like that phrasing of it, because for an animal, for a wolf or something, a piece of land does not become their territory unless they spend time in it, right, unless they are there each day.

172
0:18:24,940 --> 0:18:33,986
Speaker 3: It has to become comfortable first, and so for many people building habits, whether that's getting into the gym or going to the yoga studio or sitting your butt in the chair and writing.

173
0:18:34,447 --> 0:18:40,127
Speaker 3: You need to make that space your territory and the very first step is not getting a result.

174
0:18:40,708 --> 0:18:42,072
Speaker 3: It's spending time there.

175
0:18:42,420 --> 0:18:47,842
Speaker 3: It's making that little bit of land a zone where you feel like this is where I belong each day.

176
0:18:49,441 --> 0:18:56,586
Speaker 3: And that's a big emotional hurdle to cross before you even worry about any of the physical or like actual technical things to do.

177
0:18:56,687 --> 0:19:18,526
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I mean, the other thing that helped is I went with my wife and it's funny because I felt like you know, I'm like, uh, mr Confident, but she, she was like at one point she's like Justin, you are so nervous right now Like she could tell how nervous I was and I thought I was like keeping it all together.

178
0:19:19,941 --> 0:19:26,125
Speaker 2: And it just reminded me of like I'd been at gyms from the time I was in grade nine, all the way through college.

179
0:19:26,660 --> 0:19:31,912
Speaker 2: It wasn't like it was unfamiliar, but I was nervous because I was unfamiliar.

180
0:19:32,420 --> 0:19:39,988
Speaker 2: There had been a seven year gap and now I was like exploring this again, worried about what these people are thinking about me.

181
0:19:40,220 --> 0:19:42,688
Speaker 2: Wow, that guy looks like he's way more fit than me.

182
0:19:43,180 --> 0:20:04,169
Speaker 2: You know, like all these thoughts go through your head and so, um, yeah, I think kind of figuring out how you can like make a step and sometimes maybe it's like going with somebody, so you at least have some emotional, because it's emotional, it's nice to have someone to kind of share the emotional burden, right.

183
0:20:04,650 --> 0:20:05,031
Speaker 3: For sure.

184
0:20:05,980 --> 0:20:19,959
Speaker 3: Well, if you come, the thing that, um, ultimately what you're looking to do is, like we just said, feel like it's part of your territory and because there are other people in that space, what that also means is you're looking to feel like you're part of the tribe who goes there.

185
0:20:19,999 --> 0:20:26,848
Speaker 3: Right, that you're, you belong with the other people who are in that room, and, uh, so it helps to what?

186
0:20:26,888 --> 0:20:27,570
Speaker 3: What is a tribe?

187
0:20:27,800 --> 0:20:39,852
Speaker 3: Well, it's a group of people that you get along with, that you bond with, that you belong to over something else, over some shared interest, and, in other words, it's a group, in a lot of ways, of friends, friends who share some kind of interest.

188
0:20:40,240 --> 0:20:41,224
Speaker 3: So these are your gym friends.

189
0:20:41,425 --> 0:20:53,229
Speaker 3: Yeah, well, if you go with your wife, then you automatically have at least one person in the tribe that you are friends with, that you do belong with, and so I think that helps you get over that hurdle a little bit.

190
0:20:53,380 --> 0:20:56,249
Speaker 3: You're not, you're no longer facing that challenge alone.

191
0:20:56,500 --> 0:20:59,530
Speaker 3: You know, before it was like I am trying to get fit.

192
0:20:59,760 --> 0:21:07,811
Speaker 3: Now it is, we are trying to get fit, and that that helps a lot with the kind of the mental feeling of like, do I belong or not?

193
0:21:08,011 --> 0:21:09,981
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've also found.

194
0:21:10,081 --> 0:21:27,633
Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't mean to stay on this too long, but it's so fresh that the other thing I found myself doing because I'm interested in the emotional friction behind habits- and so the other thing I was doing is I was going in there and I'm uncomfortable.

195
0:21:28,100 --> 0:21:38,763
Speaker 2: So I'm trying to act really tough, but I'm not tough at all but I'm, you know, when people look at me I'm kind of like scowling when like, I'm not being friendly, I'm not being myself.

196
0:21:41,162 --> 0:21:53,105
Speaker 2: And I was thinking about that and thinking like when you're kind of inward focused and you're in a new environment and you're trying to develop a new habit, but you're inward focused, it really is.

197
0:21:54,809 --> 0:21:55,732
Speaker 2: It doesn't really help.

198
0:21:55,980 --> 0:22:10,363
Speaker 2: And so I had to kind of turn that around and go okay, I got to start being friendly, I got to start saying hi to these people, because if I wave at this person and it feels good like they, they respond with a smile and that happens again next time and again next time.

199
0:22:10,784 --> 0:22:13,110
Speaker 2: That's a little bit of a reward for me.

200
0:22:13,900 --> 0:22:15,226
Speaker 2: That's going to keep me going to the gym.

201
0:22:15,540 --> 0:22:30,491
Speaker 2: But if I keep going here with this like tough scowl on my face, I you know, and it's hard because you feel, you feel like you don't belong, you feel nervous and you kind of default to these old, these weird behaviors.

202
0:22:32,243 --> 0:22:36,039
Speaker 2: But I and it took a little bit of time but I'd realized okay, I got now.

203
0:22:36,059 --> 0:22:46,069
Speaker 2: I got to get in the habit of of smiling and saying hello when I'm in the gym, not just being like in my own zone and pretending I'm you know somebody.

204
0:22:46,109 --> 0:22:46,931
Speaker 2: I'm not right.

205
0:22:47,041 --> 0:22:47,765
Speaker 3: Well, that's one thing.

206
0:22:47,785 --> 0:22:51,384
Speaker 3: That kind of helps you start to belong with or become part of the rest of the tribe.

207
0:22:51,545 --> 0:22:56,547
Speaker 3: You know, like just a friendly behavior helps you start to develop friendships with some of those other people that are there.

208
0:22:57,100 --> 0:23:16,588
Speaker 3: There was a a study that I wanted to cite in atomic habits but I couldn't I couldn't find it to track it down, but I read about it years ago where the YMCA ran a survey and when they surveyed people who were joining the gym, the thing that got them to join were the different classes offered, the equipment that was in the gym.

209
0:23:16,668 --> 0:23:20,526
Speaker 3: Basically facilities and features were the things that got people in for the first time.

210
0:23:21,300 --> 0:23:37,027
Speaker 3: But then when they surveyed members who had been there for over a year, the thing that got people to stick nobody mentioned features or facilities, everybody mentioned friendships, and so the people who actually stayed at the gym or kept their membership were the ones who ended up developing friendships with other people there.

211
0:23:37,689 --> 0:23:38,591
Speaker 3: And I think you're right.

212
0:23:38,780 --> 0:23:42,170
Speaker 3: Ultimately, the thing that gets you to come back is like do I enjoy coming here?

213
0:23:42,381 --> 0:23:44,107
Speaker 3: Does it mean I get to see some of my friends?

214
0:23:44,260 --> 0:23:55,990
Speaker 3: Does it mean I get to hang out with people I like, or you know, it's really the sense of belonging that gets habits to stick, and the action itself is just kind of like something that's happening along the way.

215
0:23:56,250 --> 0:24:03,869
Speaker 2: Yes, but there's a step before that that we kind of skipped over, which is like how do you even choose a habit in the first place?

216
0:24:04,401 --> 0:24:14,771
Speaker 2: Like how does that happen In the sense of I might not know what's good for me, so how does that come into this?

217
0:24:15,541 --> 0:24:15,862
Speaker 3: Yeah.

218
0:24:16,083 --> 0:24:20,688
Speaker 3: Well, there are a lot of ways to answer that question, so I'll just share a couple of thoughts that come to mind.

219
0:24:20,920 --> 0:24:28,248
Speaker 3: So the first thought that comes to mind is this question from I first heard from Seth Godin which I think is just a great question which is what is it for?

220
0:24:29,581 --> 0:24:34,828
Speaker 3: And so this is a question that we need to ask ourselves when we're trying to build a new habit, which is what is this habit for?

221
0:24:35,521 --> 0:24:37,087
Speaker 3: What am I actually trying to achieve here?

222
0:24:37,880 --> 0:24:45,907
Speaker 3: Because the correct habit to choose is very different, based on what your goals are, what you're hoping to get as an outcome, what kind of lifestyle you want.

223
0:24:48,221 --> 0:24:51,530
Speaker 3: And so, for example, the habit of making 20 sales calls a day.

224
0:24:52,020 --> 0:24:58,124
Speaker 3: Well, if what it's for is to increase revenue and to build a successful business, that's a wonderful thing.

225
0:24:58,880 --> 0:25:05,768
Speaker 3: If you hate making sales calls and you want to spend less time working and more time with your family, that could be a terrible habit to build.

226
0:25:06,000 --> 0:25:07,425
Speaker 3: It just depends on what it's for.

227
0:25:09,661 --> 0:25:11,385
Speaker 3: So that's one question to ask.

228
0:25:11,785 --> 0:25:23,406
Speaker 3: But you are correct that we often don't know what we need in the moment, and I think part of that's just a challenge of life and a challenge of self-awareness and knowing what you need.

229
0:25:23,446 --> 0:25:31,223
Speaker 3: But life is a very complex system and so figuring out the right thing for that is sometimes it's just impossible or too many moving parts.

230
0:25:32,160 --> 0:25:36,431
Speaker 3: So I tend to default to two possible answers.

231
0:25:37,120 --> 0:25:43,968
Speaker 3: The first answer is we all need things that are so boring that we don't think about them, but are incredibly important for showing up each day.

232
0:25:44,280 --> 0:25:46,307
Speaker 3: So did you sleep eight hours?

233
0:25:46,860 --> 0:25:47,965
Speaker 3: Are you drinking enough water?

234
0:25:48,320 --> 0:25:51,849
Speaker 3: Are you spending a little bit of time walking outside or getting a little bit of sunlight?

235
0:25:52,820 --> 0:25:55,945
Speaker 3: Do you exercise consistently, whatever form is interesting to you?

236
0:25:57,040 --> 0:25:59,520
Speaker 3: Are you spending some time reading and soaking up new ideas?

237
0:25:59,821 --> 0:26:06,506
Speaker 3: Now, I'm not saying you have to do all that stuff every day, but my point is those are things that most people would be like.

238
0:26:06,586 --> 0:26:09,092
Speaker 3: Yeah, of course you should sleep and read more books and exercise.

239
0:26:09,160 --> 0:26:15,811
Speaker 3: Everybody knows that's good, but your time is almost never going to be wasted by making sure you do one of those things.

240
0:26:17,280 --> 0:26:26,172
Speaker 3: It's a fundamental that's worth spending time on, that's worth coming back to, that's worth reminding yourself of, even if you aren't sure the ideal, perfect place to focus in your life.

241
0:26:26,960 --> 0:26:28,165
Speaker 3: So that's the first answer.

242
0:26:28,560 --> 0:26:29,504
Speaker 3: I'll come back to the fundamentals.

243
0:26:30,240 --> 0:26:33,450
Speaker 3: The second answer is more broad.

244
0:26:33,820 --> 0:26:41,429
Speaker 3: I can't be specific with it because it depends on each person, but the broad application is what I would call broad funnel, tight filter.

245
0:26:42,040 --> 0:26:47,702
Speaker 3: So whenever you're trying to figure out where to focus, you need a really broad range of research.

246
0:26:47,802 --> 0:26:56,910
Speaker 3: Try to get as many options as possible, then apply a really tight, strict filter to it and just focus on the one or two best options that you've found.

247
0:26:57,520 --> 0:27:04,344
Speaker 3: So, for example, I just finished Atomic Habits a few months ago, so now I'm thinking should I write a second book?

248
0:27:04,760 --> 0:27:06,125
Speaker 3: If I should, what should that be about?

249
0:27:07,380 --> 0:27:08,484
Speaker 3: And I don't know right now.

250
0:27:08,785 --> 0:27:10,290
Speaker 3: So I'm in the broad funnel stage.

251
0:27:10,460 --> 0:27:12,728
Speaker 3: So I want to lay out as many options as possible.

252
0:27:12,760 --> 0:27:14,527
Speaker 3: I want to brainstorm a thousand titles.

253
0:27:14,740 --> 0:27:16,868
Speaker 3: I want to look at all the top books on Amazon.

254
0:27:17,320 --> 0:27:21,952
Speaker 3: I want to browse my best performing tweets and see if there's a possible thread for a book idea in there.

255
0:27:22,220 --> 0:27:26,231
Speaker 3: I want to look everywhere I can and just list all of that stuff in the same spreadsheet.

256
0:27:26,600 --> 0:27:29,930
Speaker 3: Maybe I got 1200 ideas on there really broad funnel.

257
0:27:30,560 --> 0:27:33,108
Speaker 3: But then I need to apply a very tight filter.

258
0:27:33,760 --> 0:27:37,490
Speaker 3: Is this something I'm interested in enough to spend two or three or four years working on?

259
0:27:38,320 --> 0:27:40,960
Speaker 3: Is it a topic of broad appeal to a general audience.

260
0:27:41,080 --> 0:27:47,831
Speaker 3: Are there going to be a lot of people that like this Is this something that I can actually turn into something actionable?

261
0:27:48,520 --> 0:27:50,006
Speaker 3: Can people use this in their daily life?

262
0:27:50,800 --> 0:27:53,889
Speaker 3: Is this a topic that has a lot of stories that I could tell?

263
0:27:54,480 --> 0:27:59,431
Speaker 3: Can I actually make this entertaining or latch on to other interesting stories to make the book readable?

264
0:27:59,551 --> 0:27:59,791
Speaker 3: Yes.

265
0:28:00,860 --> 0:28:02,306
Speaker 3: And those are just some of the filters.

266
0:28:02,640 --> 0:28:12,352
Speaker 3: But my point is that you want some period of very broad exploration and then, once you have a lot of options, you want to really tighten it down based on that question what is this for?

267
0:28:12,780 --> 0:28:21,671
Speaker 3: So in my case, the question I'm using is well, it's for writing a good book, one that's highly actionable, one that sells a lot of copies, one that people find useful and so on.

268
0:28:22,761 --> 0:28:30,470
Speaker 3: And so I think if you combine that broad funnel type filter strategy and that question of what is it for, that can maybe give you some more specific answers.

269
0:28:31,000 --> 0:28:34,529
Speaker 3: But even if you don't come up with something good there, you can always focus on the fundamentals.

270
0:28:34,709 --> 0:28:44,305
Speaker 2: Yes, and the other thing, when you mentioned Seth Godin, he has this other line, which is people like us do things like this.

271
0:28:45,368 --> 0:28:45,950
Speaker 3: I love that line.

272
0:28:46,320 --> 0:28:49,129
Speaker 3: I wish I had thought it up, but yes, it's so good.

273
0:28:49,320 --> 0:29:16,661
Speaker 2: It's such a great mantra and what's interesting about it is, for me, one thing that made me start thinking about healthy habits was hanging out with people who had healthy habits and in some ways it was really lucky and fortunate like you guys invited me to that retreat.

274
0:29:16,682 --> 0:29:24,683
Speaker 2: You did, and in some ways I'm thankful you guys invited a loser like me, because I was hanging out in that group.

275
0:29:26,180 --> 0:29:37,489
Speaker 2: I came and at first I was cynical and grumpy and eventually, just looking around that group, I realized, man, these people like this do things like this.

276
0:29:39,020 --> 0:29:46,204
Speaker 2: And my cynicism which before it would have been like wow, people like that do stuff like that it went down.

277
0:29:46,425 --> 0:29:52,928
Speaker 2: And then all of a sudden I was like, okay, well, if people like this do things like this, that's what I need to do.

278
0:29:54,200 --> 0:30:00,753
Speaker 2: And I think for folks that are thinking like, okay, well, how do I know what good habits are?

279
0:30:01,440 --> 0:30:06,849
Speaker 2: There are so many things that I would have never been.

280
0:30:06,869 --> 0:30:09,474
Speaker 2: What do you call it?

281
0:30:10,782 --> 0:30:20,088
Speaker 2: There's the stages of habits or whatever, but I would have never even had the cue if I had not first observed it and then noticed like, oh wait, they're doing that, they're doing that, they're doing that.

282
0:30:21,100 --> 0:30:27,991
Speaker 2: I'm the odd man out, and that's what motivated me to want to pursue some of that stuff.

283
0:30:28,600 --> 0:30:43,891
Speaker 2: But if I hadn't been in that group and felt like wait a second, like if I want to belong here, I've got to up my game right, it would have never happened, and so people like us do things like this has been really helpful for me.

284
0:30:44,922 --> 0:30:53,731
Speaker 3: Yeah, I love that phrase and one of the reasons I said that oh, I wish I had thought that up is because I think it applies so deeply to a lot of the ideas in Atomic Habits.

285
0:30:53,880 --> 0:30:58,912
Speaker 3: It applies to how socially reinforced our habits are.

286
0:30:59,120 --> 0:30:59,662
Speaker 3: I think this is.

287
0:30:59,742 --> 0:31:01,349
Speaker 3: You know, I wrote about this in the book.

288
0:31:01,400 --> 0:31:02,666
Speaker 3: I mean, I have a whole chapter on it.

289
0:31:02,960 --> 0:31:04,004
Speaker 3: Chapter nine is all about that.

290
0:31:04,840 --> 0:31:09,790
Speaker 3: But I think I still undersold the importance of how socially reinforced our habits are.

291
0:31:11,640 --> 0:31:15,551
Speaker 3: And then it also references the importance of a shared identity.

292
0:31:16,000 --> 0:31:21,865
Speaker 3: I think that ultimately, a shared identity is really one of the most powerful forces for getting habits to stick.

293
0:31:23,121 --> 0:31:29,121
Speaker 3: Like, if you look at it in a big way, you can look at like religions, people.

294
0:31:29,502 --> 0:31:32,189
Speaker 3: Religions are really interesting places to look for habits.

295
0:31:32,840 --> 0:31:40,164
Speaker 3: People get in the habit of going to church every Sunday for 50 years, largely because it's reinforced.

296
0:31:40,520 --> 0:31:46,243
Speaker 3: The other people in their neighborhoods go, the people on their block go, they see their friends there.

297
0:31:47,240 --> 0:31:49,046
Speaker 3: It's a very socially reinforced habit.

298
0:31:50,480 --> 0:31:52,367
Speaker 3: Same thing is true in smaller ways.

299
0:31:52,680 --> 0:32:05,740
Speaker 3: Like, let's say, you move into a new house and you walk outside on Tuesday night and you see all your neighbors have their recycling bins out and you're like huh, people like us do things like this, like people who live in this neighborhood recycle on Tuesday nights.

300
0:32:05,780 --> 0:32:07,346
Speaker 3: I guess we need to sign up for recycling.

301
0:32:08,200 --> 0:32:13,862
Speaker 3: And there are really almost an infinite range of examples that are like that, both large and small.

302
0:32:14,443 --> 0:32:16,047
Speaker 3: Where our habits are.

303
0:32:16,548 --> 0:32:21,388
Speaker 3: We notice them because the people around us are doing them, which is what the Q portion is you referenced.

304
0:32:22,040 --> 0:32:32,544
Speaker 3: We desire to do them, we crave to follow through on them, because by doing the same, we fit in or signal to the other people around us hey, I get it, I'm part of the tribe too.

305
0:32:34,040 --> 0:32:38,311
Speaker 3: It becomes easier to do it because sometimes you have friends helping you out.

306
0:32:39,040 --> 0:32:50,452
Speaker 3: It's like having a spotter at the gym Like, oh, people like us help each other out when a set is hard, and then ultimately it becomes satisfying because you enjoy being praised for it.

307
0:32:51,040 --> 0:33:00,610
Speaker 3: Other people are like hey, it was great to see you at church on Sunday, or really good job on that workout today, and that feels good to be praised for fitting in.

308
0:33:01,200 --> 0:33:19,053
Speaker 3: And so, in that way, socially reinforced habits or the collective identity it hits all four stages of habit formation and I knew that when I was writing it, but I don't think I gave it as much importance as I should have.

309
0:33:19,300 --> 0:33:21,567
Speaker 3: It's a very powerful driver of behavior in the long run.

310
0:33:21,627 --> 0:33:22,349
Speaker 2: Yeah, totally.

311
0:33:22,940 --> 0:33:34,670
Speaker 2: I think this is why cynicism is such a toxic attitude, and I guess I'm in Gen X.

312
0:33:34,840 --> 0:33:36,448
Speaker 2: I'm born in 1980.

313
0:33:37,100 --> 0:33:46,070
Speaker 2: There's a lot of cynicism in Gen X and then millennials also have a little bit of this too, and actually, to be honest, everybody has it.

314
0:33:46,360 --> 0:33:47,082
Speaker 2: Baby boomers have it.

315
0:33:47,142 --> 0:34:07,506
Speaker 2: When, if you're a 50-year-old programmer and you get hired at a startup where the CEO is 20 years old, we kind of default to cynicism and it's such a blocker when you're trying to observe those norms, like, oh wait, people like us do things like this.

316
0:34:08,760 --> 0:34:09,442
Speaker 2: Cynicism allows you to go.

317
0:34:09,562 --> 0:34:12,309
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, people like that do stuff like that.

318
0:34:12,790 --> 0:34:13,632
Speaker 2: That's good for them.

319
0:34:13,920 --> 0:34:18,147
Speaker 2: That's good for James Clear, but that's not good for me.

320
0:34:20,022 --> 0:34:39,614
Speaker 2: And when I'm trying to kind of reveal from my experience for anyone that ever watches this or listens to this, is that you really do need to step outside that and at least be open to this idea that your life could get better and it could just be going OK.

321
0:34:41,283 --> 0:34:47,428
Speaker 2: Well, I'm going to vote for who I'm going to be today and I'm going to vote for who I'm going to be tomorrow and I'm going to keep going.

322
0:34:48,080 --> 0:34:51,560
Speaker 2: The other thing in the book that really helped me and I'm probably going to butcher it.

323
0:34:51,580 --> 0:34:54,969
Speaker 2: So you clean up after I do it, but you show this grid.

324
0:34:55,680 --> 0:35:04,985
Speaker 2: So imagine, on this side of your day it's like, ok, I make a good decision, so it goes up, and then I make another good decision, goes up, but then I make a bad decision.

325
0:35:05,700 --> 0:35:13,513
Speaker 2: I eat a tub of ice cream, and sometimes eating the tub of ice cream is debilitating.

326
0:35:13,700 --> 0:35:21,287
Speaker 2: It's like, well, I'm done, I ate the tub of ice cream, I suck at this, I'm just going to go again into bed and forget about it.

327
0:35:22,461 --> 0:35:24,948
Speaker 2: And in your grid you show wait, but you're still up here.

328
0:35:25,960 --> 0:35:35,331
Speaker 2: You can just make another good decision and then you're back up again and I like that idea of kind of navigating your ideas, not being so hard on ourselves.

329
0:35:35,960 --> 0:35:36,803
Speaker 2: Did I kind of get that right?

330
0:35:37,846 --> 0:35:39,821
Speaker 3: Yeah, so this is the.

331
0:35:39,841 --> 0:35:41,784
Speaker 3: I don't know if you can see it, but this is the image.

332
0:35:41,885 --> 0:35:42,586
Speaker 3: Oh, yeah, yeah.

333
0:35:43,802 --> 0:35:44,285
Speaker 3: It's a.

334
0:35:46,392 --> 0:35:53,123
Speaker 3: It's this idea that, like, the difference between a good day and a bad day is often just a series of choices, right, yeah, and you can win each little moment.

335
0:35:53,427 --> 0:35:55,457
Speaker 3: Right, you can win each decisive moment.

336
0:35:55,830 --> 0:35:58,799
Speaker 3: Just because you ate the tub of ice cream doesn't mean you can't win the next moment.

337
0:36:00,529 --> 0:36:15,259
Speaker 3: Yes, and so one thing that I was thinking about when I wrote that is this concept that I call decisive moments, this idea that there are a few choices each day, maybe somewhere between, say, five and ten, that kind of determine the next chunk of time.

338
0:36:16,031 --> 0:36:35,842
Speaker 3: And so, for example, there's a moment for me each morning where I sit down and either I open up Evernote and I start writing the next start I'll call I'm going to work on, or I go to ESPN and I check the latest sports news, and what happens in the next hour is really determined by what happens in, like, the first 45 seconds.

339
0:36:35,902 --> 0:36:42,137
Speaker 3: Yes, like do I go to Evernote or do I go to ESPN, and so that is a decisive moment.

340
0:36:42,398 --> 0:36:46,625
Speaker 3: In my language, that's like a moment that determines if I can master those 45 seconds.

341
0:36:47,027 --> 0:36:50,617
Speaker 3: Then I can end up mastering the next hour that comes afterward almost automatically.

342
0:36:51,960 --> 0:36:52,782
Speaker 3: Same thing is true.

343
0:36:53,090 --> 0:37:07,110
Speaker 3: There's a moment each night, like 5.15 or so, my wife gets home from work and either we change into our workout clothes or we like sit on the couch and watch reruns, the office and order Indian food or whatever, and both of those nights are good nights.

344
0:37:07,230 --> 0:37:11,216
Speaker 3: But the moment to master is do we change into our workout clothes or not?

345
0:37:11,450 --> 0:37:13,557
Speaker 3: If we do that, it only takes a few minutes.

346
0:37:14,290 --> 0:37:18,798
Speaker 3: Everything else for the next two hours is already decided We'll get in the car, we'll drive to the gym, we'll do the reps.

347
0:37:19,932 --> 0:37:21,197
Speaker 3: It's all pretty much done at that point.

348
0:37:21,810 --> 0:37:31,339
Speaker 3: So the reason I like bringing that up or like thinking about that, is you start to realize there really isn't that much that you need to master.

349
0:37:31,970 --> 0:37:37,382
Speaker 3: Really you just are trying to focus your attention on a few key, decisive moments throughout the day.

350
0:37:38,491 --> 0:37:40,117
Speaker 3: It's kind of like applying judo to your life.

351
0:37:40,530 --> 0:37:46,255
Speaker 3: It's like apply the pressure and the leverage at just the right point and then the next hour kind of falls into place automatically.

352
0:37:47,970 --> 0:37:59,103
Speaker 3: And so I like that, because once you realize that, once you kind of identify those high leverage decision points, you can organize your day and your environment around those things.

353
0:38:00,010 --> 0:38:05,554
Speaker 3: And I also know that those 45 seconds where I'm choosing between Evernote or ESPN is a real key moment.

354
0:38:06,030 --> 0:38:17,079
Speaker 3: Well, I could install freedom and then I could block ESPN from 8am to 10am and that takes care of that decisive moment and it increases the odds that I'm going to open out instead.

355
0:38:18,490 --> 0:38:24,276
Speaker 3: But anyway, so little choices like that are easier to make once you've identified some of those key points of leverage.

356
0:38:24,450 --> 0:38:30,320
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you talk in the book like there's some tricks to where you can make things automatic.

357
0:38:33,210 --> 0:38:38,941
Speaker 2: You talk about Nira y'all buying a little device that just shuts off his internet every night at 10am.

358
0:38:39,322 --> 0:38:40,164
Speaker 3: Yeah, outlet timer.

359
0:38:40,370 --> 0:38:54,159
Speaker 2: Yeah, and what's brilliant about that is like it shuts it off, like especially if it's in the basement or whatever like you're not going to go downstairs and like fiddle around with it, and then it's just that's what happens, right?

360
0:38:56,092 --> 0:39:00,883
Speaker 2: If ESPN was really killing you, you could just cancel your cable subscription.

361
0:39:01,050 --> 0:39:04,499
Speaker 2: That might be a bit, but then you go to watch ESPN.

362
0:39:04,519 --> 0:39:05,201
Speaker 2: You can't right.

363
0:39:05,610 --> 0:39:15,718
Speaker 2: It's done, by the way, you mentioned this in the book too, but it's so funny how certain people's what is a trigger for some people is not for others.

364
0:39:16,210 --> 0:39:16,371
Speaker 2: Like.

365
0:39:16,391 --> 0:39:20,902
Speaker 2: ESPN for me is not a, that's not a temptation at all.

366
0:39:21,130 --> 0:39:22,596
Speaker 3: Yeah, it doesn't even enter your worldview.

367
0:39:22,930 --> 0:39:33,852
Speaker 2: Doesn't enter my worldview, but it shows you how identity is so much a part of this, like if I was hanging out with a bunch of Oilers fans every single day and this happened in the co-work office.

368
0:39:34,414 --> 0:39:44,921
Speaker 2: You know, there's a few people and they're watching Oilers games, you know, on their computers and I realized like if I want to talk to them, I've got to start watching Oilers games.

369
0:39:45,610 --> 0:39:52,502
Speaker 2: People like us do things like this, and so I started developing this habit of watching Oilers games when before I didn't even care.

370
0:39:53,593 --> 0:40:02,582
Speaker 3: I mean, I think this is one of the reasons why sports is so tribal, why people get so emotional about it is that it becomes a connection point for the relationships.

371
0:40:02,690 --> 0:40:08,355
Speaker 3: It's not even the game is actually no one would ever say that, because everybody acts like the game is the thing that matters the most.

372
0:40:08,536 --> 0:40:08,656
Speaker 3: Yeah.

373
0:40:09,470 --> 0:40:13,418
Speaker 3: But in a weird way it's kind of a secondary thing, you know, really like when I think back.

374
0:40:13,458 --> 0:40:20,380
Speaker 3: For me, sports is a way for my brother and I to connect and for us to have something to text about and chat about throughout the week.

375
0:40:20,850 --> 0:40:22,174
Speaker 3: It's a thing that you know.

376
0:40:22,214 --> 0:40:31,842
Speaker 3: It's a reason for my dad and I to get together in person and to go to games and hang out and like it's all the other stuff that it provides that makes it so deeply meaningful.

377
0:40:32,890 --> 0:40:37,318
Speaker 3: And then you, you know, you end up assigning a lot of that emotion to how the team does on the field as well.

378
0:40:37,639 --> 0:40:38,942
Speaker 3: Yeah, with the scores on the scoreboard.

379
0:40:39,082 --> 0:40:39,643
Speaker 3: But yeah.

380
0:40:40,390 --> 0:41:01,640
Speaker 2: So yeah, you're, it's a good example there On that topic then and this is Corey Stone is asking this in chat, but there's a lot of people on Twitter that asked us to given that example that you just gave if your meaningful relationships are engaging in habits that might not be good for you or that you want to change, how do you navigate that?

381
0:41:01,850 --> 0:41:13,895
Speaker 2: So, if you're really feeling like I got to, I got to stop watching sports, it's just like I get a little bit and then I just go crazy, but I still want to have a relationship with my brother.

382
0:41:15,050 --> 0:41:28,660
Speaker 2: This is where it gets complex, especially if you're married to somebody, Like if your wife is is like your wife is at least somewhat inclined to want to go to the gym, I'm guessing, but if she was like, no, I just want to watch Netflix and order Indian food.

383
0:41:28,850 --> 0:41:29,794
Speaker 2: That's all I want to do.

384
0:41:31,010 --> 0:41:32,655
Speaker 2: How do you start to navigate those things?

385
0:41:33,196 --> 0:41:34,420
Speaker 3: Yeah, those are good questions.

386
0:41:35,793 --> 0:41:59,958
Speaker 3: I mean, it's really hard because, especially if it's a person who you want to stay in your life, you know, I think first of all I just want to say I so I have some things I want to add to this, but I feel like it's worth noting that this question comes up a lot, and I think the reason it comes up a lot is because we all know that actually there isn't a good, easy answer and that it's like just a hard part of life.

387
0:42:00,219 --> 0:42:00,660
Speaker 3: You know what I mean.

388
0:42:01,993 --> 0:42:09,777
Speaker 3: It's one of those things we want to keep asking about in hopes that, oh, maybe there'll be an easy way to resolve this, but I think we all know like it's a challenge.

389
0:42:09,978 --> 0:42:10,239
Speaker 3: Yeah.

390
0:42:11,371 --> 0:42:13,439
Speaker 3: Now, that said, there are a few things you can do.

391
0:42:13,650 --> 0:42:20,095
Speaker 3: So first thing is, sometimes your friends and family want to do something different than how you want to change.

392
0:42:20,410 --> 0:42:22,855
Speaker 3: So, like you're, you want to stick to a new diet.

393
0:42:23,055 --> 0:42:26,141
Speaker 3: They want to eat the old way, or something like that.

394
0:42:26,321 --> 0:42:26,542
Speaker 3: Yeah.

395
0:42:27,790 --> 0:42:28,759
Speaker 3: Well, you want to start doing yoga.

396
0:42:29,010 --> 0:42:32,938
Speaker 3: They couldn't care less about yoga, they don't want to go to class with you, things like that.

397
0:42:33,590 --> 0:42:40,676
Speaker 3: Well, if that's the case, then for certain habits you don't have to like fire your friends and family to be able to do that.

398
0:42:41,650 --> 0:42:52,676
Speaker 3: But what you can, what you do need or what can be really useful, is having like a sacred space where that occurs, where I'm not saying you need to do this with me, but just don't make it harder on me, right?

399
0:42:52,930 --> 0:42:53,975
Speaker 3: Just don't conflict with.

400
0:42:54,250 --> 0:43:06,076
Speaker 3: So you know, the yoga example is an easier one, where it's like well, maybe you need to go to a yoga studio, away from the friends and family that aren't interested, and start to build friendships with people who are.

401
0:43:06,397 --> 0:43:14,259
Speaker 3: You know, I'm not saying you need to get rid of your old friends, but maybe it'd be helpful to build a couple of new ones who are into yoga, so that you have like a safe space for that habit to live.

402
0:43:15,570 --> 0:43:16,353
Speaker 3: So that's one thing.

403
0:43:17,690 --> 0:43:25,318
Speaker 3: Then there's the second piece, which is sometimes you're building a habit that you do want the person to like join you on, to come along with you.

404
0:43:25,831 --> 0:43:34,186
Speaker 3: You know you're working out and you would love for your spouse to join you at the gym or something like that and everybody know it like it would be good.

405
0:43:34,312 --> 0:43:44,857
Speaker 3: But they feel maybe they feel less comfortable there than you do, or maybe they feel you know you were previously an athlete and they were not, and so you feel kind of comfortable in the gym.

406
0:43:44,970 --> 0:43:50,535
Speaker 3: You've been there before in years past, but for them it's like new and weird and you know they feel like they're being judged and whatever.

407
0:43:52,010 --> 0:44:02,694
Speaker 3: If you're dealing with a case like that, the thing that I try to keep in mind and I can tell you from working with my own family it can be incredibly useful is praise the good, ignore the bad.

408
0:44:03,911 --> 0:44:06,192
Speaker 3: It's very hard to do, it's very.

409
0:44:06,232 --> 0:44:09,621
Speaker 3: The difficult part about it is not doing it on an individual basis.

410
0:44:09,930 --> 0:44:12,218
Speaker 3: It's that this needs to be the new lifestyle for you.

411
0:44:12,670 --> 0:44:21,540
Speaker 3: So when they do the thing that you're asking them to do, don't basically another way to phrase this is don't criticize people for doing what you were hoping they would.

412
0:44:21,841 --> 0:44:29,839
Speaker 3: You know like there are so many times when the introverted kid in the family will come down to the dinner table and it's like, oh look, who decided to join us.

413
0:44:30,370 --> 0:44:38,717
Speaker 3: It's like, well, they finally did the thing that you were hoping they would do and engage with everybody, and now they just feel like they're getting criticized for it.

414
0:44:39,370 --> 0:44:49,559
Speaker 3: Or you go to the gym and your spouse decides to join you and they do a few sets and then they feel like they're done and you say, well, that was a pretty short workout.

415
0:44:50,250 --> 0:44:57,337
Speaker 3: And what you should be saying is I think it's great that you got in here tonight, right, like you weren't feeling it, but you were still able to make it in.

416
0:44:59,112 --> 0:45:08,826
Speaker 3: And so praise the good, ignore the bad, and if you can do that in the long run, what ends up happening is everybody likes feeling praised.

417
0:45:08,986 --> 0:45:10,550
Speaker 3: Everybody likes feeling rewarded.

418
0:45:10,650 --> 0:45:11,072
Speaker 3: They like to.

419
0:45:11,373 --> 0:45:17,615
Speaker 3: It feels satisfying to do something that the people who love you and who are around you praise you for.

420
0:45:18,450 --> 0:45:23,079
Speaker 3: And so at first you go to the gym and they say hey, I'm really proud of you for getting in here tonight, good job.

421
0:45:23,319 --> 0:45:24,581
Speaker 3: Yeah, and it doesn't seem like much.

422
0:45:26,210 --> 0:45:39,453
Speaker 3: But then after two months and three months and 10 months of that, you turn around a year later and they might never even say it, but implicitly, what they've realized is, damn, every time I go to the gym it feels good, they like, they compliment me and that.

423
0:45:39,473 --> 0:45:43,372
Speaker 3: So now all of a sudden you start to associate going to the gym with feeling good.

424
0:45:44,290 --> 0:45:49,261
Speaker 3: And this is a really long game play because it takes a while for that to reinforce itself.

425
0:45:50,130 --> 0:45:58,927
Speaker 3: But you know, same thing, like the introverted kid at the table sits down and they say something that happened today and it's like oh, that's awesome, thanks for sharing that with us.

426
0:45:59,150 --> 0:46:11,998
Speaker 3: You know, I'm like on that individual night, that one night at dinner doesn't count for a lot, but if every time they speak up they're rewarded for it, then all of a sudden now they have a reason to start doing that more in the months and years to come.

427
0:46:12,610 --> 0:46:18,582
Speaker 3: So it takes a while, but I think that that's like an effective way to gradually nudge people in the right direction.

428
0:46:18,802 --> 0:46:25,297
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's someone in the chat that's saying they need to apply that idea to themselves to avoid feeling guilty for not doing enough.

429
0:46:26,050 --> 0:46:27,273
Speaker 2: So, instead of reinforced.

430
0:46:27,434 --> 0:46:28,356
Speaker 2: Oh you idiot.

431
0:46:28,417 --> 0:46:30,731
Speaker 2: You didn't go to the gym again, you fatty.

432
0:46:30,812 --> 0:46:32,356
Speaker 2: You know like that's not helpful.

433
0:46:34,072 --> 0:46:34,784
Speaker 2: There's the self talk.

434
0:46:35,130 --> 0:46:36,515
Speaker 2: It can work with self talk as well.

435
0:46:37,350 --> 0:46:47,597
Speaker 3: This is why I think small habits can be so useful in some ways, even on the bad days, because, like, let's say, you're in that situation, you just said where it's like, oh you know, skip the gym again.

436
0:46:47,838 --> 0:46:58,317
Speaker 3: Yeah Well, you can still do one pushup or one air squat or whatever before you go, do a set of 10 air squats before you hop in bed tonight, and it's not going to transform your body.

437
0:46:58,417 --> 0:46:59,881
Speaker 3: But that's not really the point.

438
0:47:00,210 --> 0:47:03,420
Speaker 3: The point is to prove to yourself that it wasn't a good day.

439
0:47:03,730 --> 0:47:10,601
Speaker 3: I didn't have the best motivation or energy, I had a long day at work, but I still am not the type of person who misses work, misses workouts.

440
0:47:11,190 --> 0:47:15,241
Speaker 3: I still proved to myself, I still cast a vote for being that kind of person.

441
0:47:15,310 --> 0:47:21,419
Speaker 3: I didn't let a day go by without doing nothing, and that can count for a lot in the long run.

442
0:47:22,231 --> 0:47:28,155
Speaker 3: And so sometimes small habits are less about the outcome they deliver and more about the identity they reinforce.

443
0:47:28,315 --> 0:47:31,314
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I've actually found you know.

444
0:47:31,454 --> 0:47:44,335
Speaker 2: Another thing I tried to I'm implementing in the new year is I decided to quit drinking alcohol and right now it's ostensibly for this goal of hitting a revenue mark.

445
0:47:44,610 --> 0:47:46,717
Speaker 2: Once I hit the goal, then I can have a drink.

446
0:47:47,470 --> 0:47:54,393
Speaker 2: But the deeper motivation for me was I just realized like it just makes it's a depressant.

447
0:47:54,513 --> 0:48:14,630
Speaker 2: It's like there's a bunch of reasons that it's not good for me and so my, my excuse or my way of trying it out is saying, well, I'm going for this goal, but it's been interesting in social situations because all my friends still drink and that's mine with me, but it's Sometimes just sharing the goal.

448
0:48:14,710 --> 0:48:22,212
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm just doing this because I'm going after this thing and and you talk about how goals are sometimes helpful in setting your direction.

449
0:48:22,933 --> 0:48:28,649
Speaker 2: You know, like again pointed this way now and Sometimes sharing that with people is helpful.

450
0:48:29,111 --> 0:48:35,335
Speaker 2: The other thing is, I think, eventually, if I just keep doing this, just for me to say, well, I'm a non-drinker now.

451
0:48:36,346 --> 0:48:43,796
Speaker 2: Yeah and so I can still go and have my favorite, and it's also nice having a thing that you like.

452
0:48:44,238 --> 0:48:48,531
Speaker 2: So my favorite non-alcoholic drink is a non-alcoholic Caesar.

453
0:48:48,772 --> 0:48:53,975
Speaker 2: It's like a Bloody Mary, and To have that drink, it's like kind of spicy.

454
0:48:54,786 --> 0:48:55,908
Speaker 2: There's a reward there.

455
0:48:56,630 --> 0:49:03,932
Speaker 2: I also have this social crutch that I can use in the situation you know, and If somebody asks me about it.

456
0:49:03,992 --> 0:49:07,345
Speaker 2: I also have this new identity, which is oh, I'm a non-drinker.

457
0:49:07,365 --> 0:49:10,378
Speaker 2: Now I just don't drink, and you talked about that.

458
0:49:10,720 --> 0:49:11,905
Speaker 2: There's some research behind that.

459
0:49:12,005 --> 0:49:19,190
Speaker 2: I know you've mentioned it a lot, but it's like I'm trying to quit smoking versus I'm a non-smoker, right, is that correct?

460
0:49:19,945 --> 0:49:20,627
Speaker 3: Correct yeah.

461
0:49:20,768 --> 0:49:24,076
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I think that that can be really helpful.

462
0:49:24,557 --> 0:49:26,267
Speaker 3: Yeah, having.

463
0:49:26,288 --> 0:49:47,410
Speaker 3: I Think what you're explaining here, the situation that you're going through, this experience you're having, is kind of it's Illustrating this process of identity change, right, it started with oh, I'm just gonna put it off for a little while while I'm attacking this goal, yeah, but then you're casting so many votes for, like you know what I haven't dragged and like I'm kind of benefiting from it, like maybe this is part of my identity.

464
0:49:47,470 --> 0:49:53,437
Speaker 3: Now, yeah, I'm a non-drinker and so, anyway, yeah, I think you're definitely on the right track there.

465
0:49:53,525 --> 0:49:56,936
Speaker 2: Yeah, and actually this is a good time to bring up two Twitter questions.

466
0:49:58,346 --> 0:50:03,376
Speaker 2: Maria Aldry asks you know, how do you maintain habits?

467
0:50:03,867 --> 0:50:08,785
Speaker 2: How ask him about maintaining habits for people with depression, anxiety or attention deficit.

468
0:50:09,708 --> 0:50:10,873
Speaker 2: Do you want to try to tackle that?

469
0:50:12,227 --> 0:50:20,479
Speaker 3: Yeah, so I've tried to be careful about saying that atomic habits is about building habits and breaking breaking bad habits, building good ones.

470
0:50:21,208 --> 0:50:33,316
Speaker 3: But it's not a book on addiction, it's not a book on depression, it's not a book about anxiety or ADHD or any of these other disorders or ailments, and I don't consider myself an expert on addiction.

471
0:50:34,288 --> 0:51:03,260
Speaker 3: However, something interesting has happened, so I published the book and I have had a ton of speaking requests recently and so I've been doing speeches at conferences and companies and different events and whatever yeah and so many times I get someone that comes up to me afterward or that asks a question during Q&A that talks about how useful the book was for their son who had ADHD, or their cousin was a meth addict and then was able to like start to, you know, write the ship by employing some of these techniques or whatever.

472
0:51:03,421 --> 0:51:05,888
Speaker 3: Yeah, which is great, which is very gratifying.

473
0:51:06,229 --> 0:51:08,154
Speaker 3: I still stand by my original statement.

474
0:51:08,294 --> 0:51:09,457
Speaker 3: I'm not an expert on addiction.

475
0:51:09,686 --> 0:51:20,012
Speaker 3: I don't want to like take a strong stance with this stuff, but what I've realized is that the principles that I lay out in atomic habits are really about how human behavior works.

476
0:51:20,193 --> 0:51:21,805
Speaker 3: It's about how habits are formed.

477
0:51:21,965 --> 0:51:34,016
Speaker 3: Yeah and whether that habit is something extreme, like an addiction or picking your skin or OCD or ADHD or whatever, or whether it's something more moderate, like meditating for three minutes a day.

478
0:51:34,217 --> 0:51:34,417
Speaker 3: Yes.

479
0:51:35,146 --> 0:51:42,259
Speaker 3: The fundamentals tend to be similar, and so I'm not gonna say that the book offers a prescription for overcoming addictions.

480
0:51:42,666 --> 0:51:50,594
Speaker 3: But what I will say is you be hard-pressed to find tactics in the book that wouldn't at least help Right there, wouldn't at least nudge people in the right direction?

481
0:51:50,634 --> 0:51:59,316
Speaker 3: Yeah, I have heard from a few readers who specifically have said that, uh, they had ADHD and they found the book very helpful.

482
0:52:00,685 --> 0:52:05,785
Speaker 3: Environment design, for whatever reason, has been something that's come up multiple times for folks who have struggled with that.

483
0:52:05,965 --> 0:52:07,508
Speaker 3: Yeah, so you know it's.

484
0:52:07,729 --> 0:52:15,472
Speaker 3: I think it's kind of like, if you're the type of person who is less likely to just remember to do it Right, or like just follow your to-do list.

485
0:52:15,873 --> 0:52:29,538
Speaker 3: If that's not you, then structuring an environment where it's easier to see the cues of your good habits, less likely to see the distractions, less friction between you and the good behavior, more friction between you and the bad ones.

486
0:52:30,106 --> 0:52:34,137
Speaker 3: If you place yourself in that space, it's much more likely that you're gonna follow through.

487
0:52:34,385 --> 0:52:45,776
Speaker 3: So you know, those are things that I talk about in chapters six and twelve, but I think that the book applies, um, but I I don't pitch it as like a prescription for someone dealing with a more serious issue, totally.

488
0:52:45,957 --> 0:53:02,918
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I would say Again, I'm not an expert either, but as someone who has been Uh dealing with depression the past couple years, uh, having a professional that you go to that deals with this stuff all the time, like a therapist, is so helpful.

489
0:53:03,966 --> 0:53:09,577
Speaker 2: And the therapist will be very interested if you read james's book.

490
0:53:10,106 --> 0:53:16,311
Speaker 2: So I said to my therapist I'm like you know she starts way back here and then she says so, what's new with you?

491
0:53:16,351 --> 0:53:20,199
Speaker 2: I'm like, well, you know, I read this book and I'm thinking, oh, what are you thinking about dealing with that?

492
0:53:20,686 --> 0:53:23,948
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm thinking about maybe, um, quitting alcohol.

493
0:53:24,189 --> 0:53:24,670
Speaker 2: Oh, well, that's.

494
0:53:25,011 --> 0:53:28,078
Speaker 2: You know, there's some reinforcement from the professionals.

495
0:53:29,365 --> 0:53:31,850
Speaker 2: And uh, likewise with my, my doctor.

496
0:53:32,211 --> 0:53:46,553
Speaker 2: You know, when I, when I had depression and I went to my physician, she said she gave me two prescriptions Um, quit drinking alcohol and quit uh taken any kind of cannabis.

497
0:53:48,126 --> 0:53:51,837
Speaker 2: And the reason is she says those are going to make you feel bad.

498
0:53:52,406 --> 0:53:54,677
Speaker 2: Now, the trigger in that case was my doctor.

499
0:53:54,697 --> 0:53:57,369
Speaker 2: It's nice when you have a doctor saying listen, this is your prescription.

500
0:53:57,470 --> 0:54:00,782
Speaker 2: Oh, and double the amount of exercise I was doing so, three things.

501
0:54:03,449 --> 0:54:29,091
Speaker 2: So I did that for three months and then I went back to my old habits, but now I have that memory of what it was like for three months and it's been a powerful trigger for me to you know, when I am starting to notice my mood go down, I can remember my doctor's prescription was quit drinking, quit eating edibles and doubling my exercise, and that's been helpful for me personally.

502
0:54:29,345 --> 0:54:33,726
Speaker 2: So I think if you're reading the book, let your professional in your life know about it.

503
0:54:34,710 --> 0:54:35,111
Speaker 2: It's good.

504
0:54:36,147 --> 0:54:39,459
Speaker 2: And one thing I want you to do is because I love the imagery.

505
0:54:39,599 --> 0:54:45,793
Speaker 2: But and this is probably unfair to you is to give the ice cube example, but use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.

506
0:54:49,545 --> 0:54:57,633
Speaker 3: So this is an example from the first chapter of the book and I actually, as a side note, I thought about this.

507
0:54:57,745 --> 0:55:01,166
Speaker 3: I was like man, we're going to have to get these changed for the foreign editions, like we're going to.

508
0:55:01,186 --> 0:55:20,069
Speaker 3: It's going to need to be, but anyway, so yeah, the core idea is that the process of changing your habits is well, it's similar to what we talked about early on, that there's often this valley of death, that there's this period where you're just kind of building up latent potential but you're not really releasing any other results yet.

509
0:55:20,985 --> 0:55:24,101
Speaker 3: And I like to equate it to the process of heating up an ice cube.

510
0:55:24,282 --> 0:55:25,146
Speaker 3: You know, so you've got.

511
0:55:25,667 --> 0:55:36,506
Speaker 3: You've got this ice cube sitting on a table, right, and so let's say it's like negative three degrees in there, right, so you're a negative three, it's cold, you can see your breath, the ice cube's sitting there.

512
0:55:36,646 --> 0:55:38,834
Speaker 3: You heated up negative two, negative one.

513
0:55:39,406 --> 0:55:41,070
Speaker 3: Still there's this ice cube sitting there.

514
0:55:41,271 --> 0:55:42,173
Speaker 3: Nothing has happened, right?

515
0:55:43,625 --> 0:56:01,497
Speaker 3: Then you go from negative one to zero and all of a sudden you have this one degree shift, no different than any of the other shifts that came before it, but you have this phase transition, right, and like, the ice cube starts melting, and that, I think, is indicative of what it often feels like to change a habit.

516
0:56:01,665 --> 0:56:13,038
Speaker 3: You're making these little improvements, you're trying to make these 1% changes, these one degree shifts, each day, and you're like it's really easy to get frustrated or even depressed at that point.

517
0:56:13,585 --> 0:56:15,490
Speaker 3: You know it's like I've been running for three weeks.

518
0:56:15,530 --> 0:56:17,134
Speaker 3: How come I can't see a change in my body?

519
0:56:17,194 --> 0:56:20,069
Speaker 3: Yeah, I've been blog post for six months now.

520
0:56:20,130 --> 0:56:21,694
Speaker 3: How come this site isn't popular yet?

521
0:56:22,585 --> 0:56:27,176
Speaker 3: And the key point there is your work was not being wasted, it's just being stored.

522
0:56:28,145 --> 0:56:40,476
Speaker 3: Complaining about sticking to a habit for two months or three months, or even six months or a year and not having the outcome that you want is kind of like complaining about heating ice cube from negative three to negative one degrees and not melting it.

523
0:56:40,845 --> 0:56:44,055
Speaker 3: You know, like the work was not wasted, it's just being stored.

524
0:56:44,445 --> 0:56:45,467
Speaker 3: And I love that quote.

525
0:56:46,309 --> 0:57:07,894
Speaker 3: That's in that same section from Jacob Reese, who it hangs in the locker room of the San Antonio, who won five NBA championships, and it says essentially when I feel like giving up, I think about the stone cutter who continues to hammer away at the stone a hundred times without it splitting, and then finally, on the hundred and first blow, it cracks in two.

526
0:57:08,485 --> 0:57:10,874
Speaker 3: And I know that it wasn't the hundred that can't there.

527
0:57:10,965 --> 0:57:16,752
Speaker 3: I know it wasn't the hundred and first swing that did it, but the hundred that came before and like it's that same idea.

528
0:57:17,005 --> 0:57:25,275
Speaker 3: You know, the reason the site takes off is not because of the one viral article, it's because of the 55 that you wrote in the weeks and months prior.

529
0:57:25,745 --> 0:57:31,391
Speaker 3: The reason that you see a change in your body is not because today's workout radically transformed you.

530
0:57:31,472 --> 0:57:37,295
Speaker 3: It's because you've been sticking to it for eight months now and it's really about showing up.

531
0:57:37,436 --> 0:57:46,195
Speaker 3: Continue to put those swings in, continue to raise the temperature by one degree and eventually you hit that phase transition where you can see the results of your work.

532
0:57:46,556 --> 0:58:20,456
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that image has been so powerful in my life, the real, like I've been telling people about this book and I actually noticed there's kind of like a coffee shop test, like if I hear people talking about something from internet culture in a coffee shop like real people then something's hit and atomic habits is like that, like it hit the kind of mainstream and that image of just raising the temperature a little bit every day.

533
0:58:21,725 --> 0:58:32,340
Speaker 2: Now I feel like I'm a few months into this and I'm a little bit kind of like evangelical about it.

534
0:58:32,905 --> 0:58:42,294
Speaker 2: Like I'm saying, now I'm like God, like my life is so much better and it's because of just these little changes over time in the same direction.

535
0:58:43,917 --> 0:58:44,799
Speaker 2: Now I can see it.

536
0:58:44,945 --> 0:58:46,752
Speaker 2: Now I can see that I feel better.

537
0:58:47,185 --> 0:58:49,754
Speaker 2: You know, wow, man, quitting alcohol, that was one thing.

538
0:58:50,005 --> 0:58:53,335
Speaker 2: And then, wow, showing up at the gym three or four times a week, that really helps.

539
0:58:54,026 --> 0:58:56,333
Speaker 2: And wow, like reading a real book every night before I go to bed.

540
0:58:56,845 --> 0:59:11,247
Speaker 2: All of these things keep kind of adding up and do make a meaningful difference in your life, even though way back when, when you're starting, you feel like, well, nothing's going to help me, now it's.

541
0:59:11,488 --> 0:59:16,197
Speaker 2: I want to be clear that these ideas have meaningfully impacted my life.

542
0:59:16,985 --> 0:59:18,611
Speaker 2: So I'm yeah, I'm really thankful.

543
0:59:19,285 --> 0:59:23,374
Speaker 2: I'm thankful you wrote that book, I'm thankful you, you talked to me in the airport.

544
0:59:23,505 --> 0:59:24,755
Speaker 2: It's been really great for me.

545
0:59:25,722 --> 0:59:26,065
Speaker 3: That's awesome.

546
0:59:26,286 --> 0:59:30,494
Speaker 3: Thank you so much for sharing that, and ultimately, that's what the whole thing is for, right?

547
0:59:30,565 --> 0:59:36,077
Speaker 3: I mean it just it makes it feel like it was worth the effort to spend a few years writing it and working on it, so that's great.

548
0:59:37,306 --> 0:59:44,010
Speaker 2: So, before you go, some people are asking like, what recommendations for system services, tools, trackers?

549
0:59:44,185 --> 0:59:45,769
Speaker 2: I know you have a new one coming out.

550
0:59:45,809 --> 0:59:46,611
Speaker 2: Do you want to talk about that?

551
0:59:47,412 --> 0:59:49,517
Speaker 3: Sure, yeah, so I got it right here next to me actually.

552
0:59:49,925 --> 0:59:56,638
Speaker 3: So this is a habit journal and we we just launched it two weeks ago and it's got.

553
0:59:56,919 --> 0:59:58,210
Speaker 3: It's basically a dot grid notebook.

554
0:59:58,345 --> 1:00:06,172
Speaker 3: So if you're into bullet journaling or you're into keeping a notebook or use a notebook, the vast majority of it are dot grid pages, so you'll be able to use it like any normal one.

555
1:00:06,585 --> 1:00:13,495
Speaker 3: But then at the back there's a section with a habit tracker templates, and I don't know if you can see that very well, but I've been using it.

556
1:00:13,625 --> 1:00:27,229
Speaker 3: For example, this is this month, so you can see me tracking my habits on here, and so, anyway, those templates are in the back and they're also perforated so you can tear them out and put them on your desk or put them on your kitchen counter or your refrigerator or whatever.

557
1:00:28,306 --> 1:00:33,027
Speaker 3: And then, and then at the very beginning of the book, there is a section called one line per day.

558
1:00:34,145 --> 1:00:44,757
Speaker 3: So I've been using it for what happened today and so I've been writing down what happened each day, and there are 31 lines, so one for each day of the month and there are 12 of them.

559
1:00:44,925 --> 1:00:48,415
Speaker 3: So by the time you get to the end of the year, you should be able to flip through and see.

560
1:00:48,825 --> 1:00:51,151
Speaker 3: You know if you I'm doing what happened today?

561
1:00:51,251 --> 1:00:52,494
Speaker 3: Sean Blanc, it does.

562
1:00:52,995 --> 1:00:54,227
Speaker 3: What's the highlight of the day?

563
1:00:55,385 --> 1:00:57,793
Speaker 3: Some other ones that I've seen are you know, what am I grateful for?

564
1:00:58,245 --> 1:01:00,072
Speaker 3: Or you could use it as like a productivity thing.

565
1:01:00,205 --> 1:01:02,271
Speaker 3: You could say, like, what's my most important task today?

566
1:01:02,853 --> 1:01:03,354
Speaker 3: Things like that.

567
1:01:03,985 --> 1:01:09,070
Speaker 3: But there are a lot of examples in the back of the notebook who I have like 16 pages of examples of how to use it.

568
1:01:10,147 --> 1:01:14,152
Speaker 3: But anyway, it's called the Havoc Journal and, yeah, I'm excited about it.

569
1:01:14,205 --> 1:01:17,214
Speaker 3: I think it'll be a good tool to help people build better habits Cool.

570
1:01:18,025 --> 1:01:18,567
Speaker 2: And a lot of folks.

571
1:01:18,627 --> 1:01:20,634
Speaker 2: I've heard from a lot of folks that really like the audiobook.

572
1:01:20,865 --> 1:01:23,252
Speaker 2: So if you folks aren't readers, go check out the audiobook.

573
1:01:24,405 --> 1:01:26,258
