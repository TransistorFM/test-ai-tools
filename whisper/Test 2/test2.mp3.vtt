WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 I'm Noah and I'm Ben and you're

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.400
 listening to Product Journey.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.070
 Hi folks, today we got Justin

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.360
 Jackson on the podcast.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.290
 He is the co-founder of Trans

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.330
istor, which is a podcasting

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.760
 hosting company.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 He's also the founder of MegaM

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.650
aker, a community for founders

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.550
 and of course, avid podcast

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.780
 lover

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.780
 and listener.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.780
 Hi Justin.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.780
 Hey, how's it going?

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.780
 It's nice to be here.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.780
 Thanks for coming on Justin.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.340
 I listen to the show every week

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.780
 so it's fun to finally talk to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.880
 people that you only hear

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.760
 talking to you.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.760
 Yes, same actually.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 Yeah.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760
 Stuck to have you.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.550
 Yeah, we can kind of finally

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.010
 make this one by one connection

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.400
.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.710
 Now we can just like talk

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.530
 actually together instead of, "

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.520
Oh you listen then I'll listen."

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.760
 Yeah, totally.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.660
 It's funny also because I've

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.640
 seen Ben before.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 We've never talked, but I had

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.010
 to come up with a vision in my

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.440
 head of what Noah looked like

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.160
 and now I can actually see.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160
 Oh that's good.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.510
 For the rest of the listeners

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.960
 at home, they don't know yet,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.800
 but now I know.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.880
 I'm a part of the secret club.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.760
 Yeah was it what you expected?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.110
 Well usually, I've been podcast

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.900
ing since 2012 and usually I'm

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.120
 the disappointment when people

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 meet me in person.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.450
 They go, "I thought you'd be a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.680
 lot taller."

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.240
 Yeah, I feel like that always

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.010
 happens when you hear someone's

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.920
 voice.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.450
 If it's deeper, you kind of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.210
 depict a certain kind of person

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.080
 in your mind or if it's, yeah,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.280
 it just depends on the voice

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 and then usually it's always

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.080
 ignored what you're thinking.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 Yeah.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.300
 See if I had to guess, I'd

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.910
 guess that Noah is about six

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.150
 feet tall and I'm going to

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.800
 guess

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.440
 Ben is about the same height as

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.800
 me.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.160
 I'm five foot eight.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 How did I do?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.440
 So you're pretty good.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.120
 I'm six foot three.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120
 Okay.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.370
 I'm trying to calculate

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.200
 centimeters to foot right now.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 Oh yeah.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.720
 See this is the weird Canadian

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.240
 thing is that we use the metric

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.680
 system, but we are so close

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.300
 to the US that we end up doing

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000
 measurements in inches.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.840
 So I'm almost exactly six foot

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.400
 tall.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.130
 Oh, you're almost exactly six

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.640
 feet.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.640
 Okay.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.180
 See now everybody knows,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.080
 everybody's just adjusted.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080
 You may know mine.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.780
 Maybe you should just attach

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.320
 images to the show notes so

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320
 photos of us.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.030
 I think every podcast show

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.730
 notes needs to have stats on

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.480
 people.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.400
 Noah, six foot three.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400
 Ben.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 Yeah.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.000
 60, how many centimeters is

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.360
 that?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.600
 It's 185 or 186.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 185 centimeters.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 Yeah.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 Give people some stats.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 That's what they want to hear.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.700
 Blue eyes, dark, blondish,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.880
 pretty blonde hair.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.960
 Form a picture.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.370
 So yeah, so we're glad to have

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.600
 you on the show, Justin.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.310
 Two topics that we're kind of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.030
 interested in that I know you

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.680
 talk a decent amount about

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.860
 is like audience building and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.040
 like your market and starting

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.000
 with a market instead of an

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.240
 idea.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.560
 So we kind of wanted to jump

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.280
 into both those two topics and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.840
 just kind of dig deeper into

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840
 that.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.840
 Perfect.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.260
 It's like my favorite thing to

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.480
 talk about right now.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.480
 Yeah.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.200
 I think some people are getting

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.750
 sick of me talking about it,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.120
 but I just can't stop thinking

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.120
 about it.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.710
 So it's what naturally kind of

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.920
 comes out.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.930
 And actually, we had a question

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.560
 about that kind of like with

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.200
 building an audience.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.270
 That was one of the things we

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.200
're interested in.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.270
 Do you ever feel like you run

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.200
 out of new things to say?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.060
 I mean, one thing that's been

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.780
 helpful for me is that since

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.280
 2013, we've had this online

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.840
 community with Mega Maker.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.670
 And so people are interacting

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.430
 and asking questions all the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.000
 time.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.740
 And those discussions often

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.340
 inspire my thinking of, oh,

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.720
 wait a second.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.970
 It's actually like a lot of my

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.390
 tweets come out of

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.650
 conversations that I've had

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.280
 inside

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.750
 of Mega Maker or things I'm

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.340
 listening to on a podcast or

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.260
 even things I've read in a book

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.680
.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.930
 You know, I'm reading something

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.200
.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.360
 It brings up these thoughts.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.700
 And I treat Twitter kind of

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.620
 like the local comedy club, you

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.200
 know, where you go and test

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.200
 out material.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.810
 And she's like, OK, I'm going

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.100
 to try this out and see how it

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.040
 lands.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.370
 And it's also just a helpful

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.260
 way for me to process my

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.480
 thinking.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.370
 So no, I haven't run out of

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.480
 things to talk about yet.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.160
 I do have moments like John and

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.920
 I are doing our podcast now.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.570
 And I think we're ready for the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.170
 year to be done in some ways,

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.680
 you know, like ready for

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.600
 things to kind of wind down.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.830
 And so I think there's such

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.260
 thing as fatigue when you're

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.200
 publishing something every week

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.290
 and you eventually need to give

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.880
 your brain space to just

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.280
 explore, you know, other things

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.840
 and have other ideas.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.890
 But yeah, not most of the time,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.660
 as long as I'm interacting with

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.040
 people and real life

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.980
 situations and also doing

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.170
 experiments in my own life, I

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.480
 don't have run out of anything

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.080
 to say yet.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.770
 Yeah, I could see the fatigue

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.440
 in that, like, you feel like

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.730
 you're you have to have

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.520
 something

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.500
 to say, like at least every

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.690
 week when you have the podcast,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.680
 like you have to have a new

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.630
 thing that you're thinking

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.750
 about or that you can dive into

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.080
.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.290
 Yeah, we've definitely kind of

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.240
 seen that.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.200
 I think this is what that's why

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.520
 breaks are important.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.830
 I almost get this more with

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.340
 because podcasting, you can

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.740
 just turn on the mics and if

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.880
 you

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.190
 have a rough idea of where you

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.910
 want to go, you can talk it out

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.960
.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.330
 But writing, I find is a lot

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.500
 more takes a lot more of my

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.520
 energy.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.520
 And so like writing that weekly

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.220
 newsletter that I write is

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.080
 there are definitely weeks

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.360
 where that is tough.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.980
 Not because I don't have an

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.980
 idea, but sometimes to process

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.920
 ideas and actually write it in

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.720
 a way that makes sense is hard.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.710
 But yeah, in either case,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.840
 breaks are good.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.630
 I can't always say I'm

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.730
 receiving that newsletter and

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.760
 you're doing pretty good, I

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.440
 guess.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.400
 At least I'm enjoying it.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.170
 That almost gives me more

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.210
 pressure because then I'm like,

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.840
 "Oh, I like it.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.840
 I got to keep going."

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.840
 Yeah.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.840
 When that came down now.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.720
 In that case, I hated it every

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.400
 time.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.320
 So we got a couple of questions

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.180
 about audience and I think I

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.160
 have a pretty interesting one

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.620
 that is what makes a good

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.460
 audience and do you think that

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.400
 you should like, do you think

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.870
 you have to be part of your

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.680
 audience?

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.540
 Do you have to feel comfortable

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.480
 among the people?

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.130
 So I've actually changed my

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.800
 tune a little bit on this.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.860
 I think now if you're starting

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.920
 a business, the market is the

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.840
 most important thing, the

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.840
 market you choose.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.220
 And when I say market, I don't

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.500
 mean market as in just a ident

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.800
ifiable group of people.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.770
 I'm talking about a group of

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.400
 people that buys X. So the

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.830
 diamond market last year was 4.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.080
5

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.920
 billion or something like that.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.160
 To me, that's a market.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.730
 It's a market where you can see

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.210
 people in motion preferably

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.320
 buying something, but sometimes

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.410
 it's just people in motion

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.080
 doing something.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.950
 And everything kind of hinges

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.160
 on that which market you are in

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.240
.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.790
 So as an example, Taylor Ott

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.340
well is the founder of Laravel,

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.800
 which is the most popular PHP

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.870
 programming framework in the

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.520
 world.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.520
 He has a huge audience.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.610
 If you look at his audience,

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.760
 quote unquote, on Twitter, he's

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.560
 got hundreds of thousands

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560
 of followers.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.470
 Let's just check because I don

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.680
't want people to be.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.830
 So Ottwell, he has 82,000

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.520
 followers on Twitter.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.490
 So for a lot of people, that

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.440
 would be a big audience.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.630
 And if you go to LaraCon, you

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.300
 see he's got 800 people in the

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.320
 audience.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.610
 And he has tons of people

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:07.760
 buying his stuff.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.510
 He has millions of people using

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.600
 Laravel.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.440
 But all of that is in the

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.200
 context of a bigger market.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.480
 It's hard to count the number

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.930
 of programmers in the world,

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.320
 but let's just say a reasonable

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.200
 estimate is that there's 5

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.320
 million PHP programmers in the

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320
 world.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320
 Would you agree with that, Ben?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320
 Yeah, definitely.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.260
 I've actually used Laravel for

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.840
 a couple of projects.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.760
 Okay, there you go.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.780
 And so 5 million PHP

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.560
 programmers in the world.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.720
 And let's just take one element

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.940
 of that market, not including

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.920
 all the tools they buy, not

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.790
 including everything else that

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.560
 you need to be a programmer.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.680
 Let's just think about salary.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.800
 And these are just guesses.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.330
 But let's say on average, an

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.340
 average PHP programmer in the

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.800
 world makes $25,000 a year.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.820
 Well 25,000 times 5 million is

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.480
 $125 billion, I think.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.860
 That's $125 billion being spent

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.530
 on salaries for PHP developers

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.440
 alone.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.880
 That's a massive market.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.530
 It's not just a big group of

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.320
 people, but it's also a big

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.160
 group of people where there's

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:31.360
 some

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.200
 sort of economic activity being

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.880
 generated.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.100
 I think it's why products in

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.460
 the Laravel community often

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.260
 have a magnified impact

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.960
 compared to other

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960
 things.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.570
 So, I have a course called

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.420
 Marketing for Developers that

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.760
 did pretty good.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.120
 That's like if you take all of

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.570
 the developers in the world and

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.600
 then you ask how many of

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.740
 those developers want to learn

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.040
 marketing, it's a much smaller

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.280
 slice, right?

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.070
 How many developers in the

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.100
 world are PHP developers that

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.480
 want to make their jobs better?

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.840
 Well that's probably 5 million.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.610
 And so you can compare results

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.000
 and you can see that kind of

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.200
 everything hinges on the

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.200
 market.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.060
 How big your audience can be

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.450
 within that market and then all

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.810
 the multiples all kind of

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.080
 depend

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080
 on that.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.370
 So, how much money is being

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.680
 spent in that market already

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.960
 and how much of that can you

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.800
 carve off for yourself?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.240
 Taylor, presumably, he's only

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.170
 carved off a little bit of the

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.480
 PHP market.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.960
 There's still other frameworks.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.210
 There's still programmers that

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.160
 don't know or use Laravel.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.320
 So, he's still got plenty of

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.080
 room to grow as well.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.000
 But even then, Taylor Ottwell

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.980
 as a solo person has sold $10

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.760
 million worth of software to

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.160
 PHP developers.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.000
 That's pretty crazy.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.240
 That's insane.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.620
 And he just recently took on

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.360
 employees.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.830
 So, there's funded startups in

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.030
 San Francisco right now that

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.240
 have millions of dollars in

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.080
 funding, staff of 50 people and

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.730
 they haven't sold $10 million

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.480
 worth of software.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.420
 I think the market that you're

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.200
 in determines everything.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.070
 And when you have what Corey G

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.490
wynn calls demonstrated demand,

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.040
 so you can actually see the

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.640
 demand

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.870
 that's kind of what you're

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.240
 looking for.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.420
 You're looking for people in

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.870
 motion, a large group of people

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.840
 in motion who are where there's

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.330
 economic activity being

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.270
 generated from whatever they're

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:57.880
 doing.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.730
 So, you would basically say

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.780
 start out with the market, try

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.400
 to find a market that you

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.610
 want to work in and then start

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.830
 building an audience around

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.560
 that.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.980
 Don't worry as much about do

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.570
 you feel comfortable in that

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.720
 audience or those kind of

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.760
 things.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.660
 I mean, this is where it gets

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.400
 tricky.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.820
 This is why business is so hard

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.230
 because you apply all of these

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.160
 filters to get to where

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.160
 you want to go.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.300
 So, it's not enough to just be

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.040
 in a good market.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.380
 You actually have to be

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.200
 interested in that market.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.370
 You have to have good founder

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.000
 market fit.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.670
 You have to then be able to

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.860
 identify some sort of need in

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.160
 that market.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.700
 You have to actually execute on

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.220
 some things and make some sort

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.720
 of connection.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.320
 I don't think you have to

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.680
 necessarily build an audience.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.050
 But you get a lot of leverage

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.750
 from who you know and who knows

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.760
 you.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.510
 Who you know is just making

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.640
 connections.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.990
 We're making connections right

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.320
 now.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.540
 Now the three of us know each

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.720
 other.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.340
 Even the fact that we've been

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.860
 on a phone call makes it a lot

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.480
 easier for me to ask a favor

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.180
 of you in the future or for you

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.480
 to ask a favor of me.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.480
 That's networking.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.480
 That's who you know.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.770
 Who knows you is the audience

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.800
 effect.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.800
 That could be very helpful.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.980
 But there are people who have

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.460
 built businesses without doing

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.160
 that.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.010
 Ruben Gammes is a good example

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.820
 of someone who's just built a

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.840
 software business almost purely

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.000
 on search engine results and

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.990
 optimizing search engine

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.960
 results.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.690
 I think it's one of the levers

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.120
 you can use.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.690
 I think without any sort of

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.270
 human connection it's very

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.160
 difficult.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.950
 So you do have to connect with

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.200
 other human beings.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.660
 This is why it's helpful to be

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.210
 interested in the market you're

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.920
 in.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.890
 Sometimes it can even that can

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.920
 be enough.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.600
 I'm really interested in the

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.960
 Laravel community.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.360
 I'm not really a Laravel

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.040
 developer but I've spoken at

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.080
 their conference three times.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.150
 I really like the people and I

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.540
 would say I'm part of the

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.040
 community even though I'm not

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:49.280
 like a power user of Laravel.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.710
 There has to be something that

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.080
 draws you to that market.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.410
 There has to be something that

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.590
 keeps you there and you're

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:55.870
 probably going to need some

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.120
 sort

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.220
 of connection with some key

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.460
 people in that market to make

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.720
 it work.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.050
 How you get there is kind of

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.520
 the individual journey.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.440
 I'm almost 40 now.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.930
 It's very difficult to say what

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.900
 are the 10 steps that brought

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.800
 you to transistor because

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.350
 it's like layer on layer on

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.140
 layer of my life going back to

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.000
 when I was a kid.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.550
 And so all of those steps up

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.220
 till now lead me to where I'm

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.240
 at now.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.050
 I think you can optimize for

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.000
 some of those things like where

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.680
 you point yourself in life

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.120
 has a big determination of

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.280
 where you'll end up.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.550
 I think the connections you

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.280
 make matter a lot.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.450
 I think what you put out into

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.600
 the world matters a lot.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.420
 So podcasting, blogging, public

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.970
 speaking, but even just

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.010
 anything not open source

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.560
 projects,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.120
 anything you put out into the

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.800
 world can help.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.660
 But in terms of like adding all

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.220
 those up and going OK what

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.440
 really matters a lot harder to

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.960
 figure that out.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.400
 Yeah, I think that's a pretty

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.980
 interesting point because when

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.680
 we started out with a podcast

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.080
 I think we were both on the

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.550
 track of we should build an

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.400
 audience.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.520
 And it's kind of like we're

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.560
 shifting away from that a

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.800
 little bit.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.700
 And just recently came across

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.540
 this tweet from Jane Portman

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.280
 and I think Rob Walling, Jane

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.950
 Portman from UserList who were

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.650
 also talking about that, like

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.400
 how they didn't really need

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400
 an audience.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.010
 But basically it just fits very

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.210
 well to what you just said I

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.120
 guess.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.130
 And there's one more thing that

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.560
 I would like to get your

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.320
 opinion on because you're

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.360
 probably

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.190
 familiar with Derek Reimer and

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.160
 what happened with Level, right

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.440
?

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.270
 It's kind of like do you feel

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.240
 like having an audience might

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.120
 not always be not necessary

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.190
 but also maybe lead to false

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.320
 positives?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.880
 Oh definitely, yeah.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.090
 And it can be really helpful

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.680
 too.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.360
 There's to say that my audience

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.990
 didn't help in launching Trans

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.640
istor would be disingenuous.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.840
 Like that it definitely helped.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.840
 It still helps.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.830
 But there is a risk because

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.280
 what you're looking for is you

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.200
're looking for some sort of

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.120
 momentum,

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.160
 right?

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.440
 And when you launch something

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.330
 you're trying to gauge what

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.700
 kind of response is this

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.560
 getting.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.330
 So when Apple releases the new

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.930
 iPhone how many people are

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.680
 lined up outside of the Apple

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.680
 store, right?

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.880
 Now this Apple actually can

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.360
 fall prey to this because they

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.560
've got all these mega fans,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.600
 right?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.810
 That are going to line up day

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.800
 one no matter what.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.250
 So you could see these huge

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:04.950
 lineups and you could go oh wow

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.400
 like the new iPhone is a big

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.070
 success but unless the rest of

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.500
 the world shows up then it's

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.960
 not going to be a success,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.960
 right?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.450
 So yeah that's a pretty good

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.120
 analogy.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.260
 Yeah lineups on day one I mean

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.440
 they are helpful but they can

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.310
 also you know like I've

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.080
 launched

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.620
 things I think still to this

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.380
 day my best launch ever was for

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.880
 this I was doing this online

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.530
 series on product marketing and

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.740
 like the first couple weeks

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.880
 tons of people showed up and

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.400
 when I started asking them what

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.760
 are you hoping to achieve you

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.240
 know out of this what brought

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.320
 you here they said oh I'm just

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.700
 a big fan I just get everything

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.040
 that you put out and

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.540
 that's nice but it became

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.660
 really clear in the coming

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.430
 months that no one else cared

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.080
 and

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.370
 that's the disadvantage of

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.830
 having an audience when people

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.320
 are really kind of invested in

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.770
 your journey they're going to

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.050
 show up no matter what they're

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:13.280
 going to show up just because

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.730
 they have a personal connection

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.080
 to you but ultimately if you're

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.880
 going to run a business

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.000
 you need people who are going

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.170
 to show up and then more people

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.120
 who are going to show up

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.640
 and then more people are going

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.630
 to show up right and this is

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.080
 actually why I think the

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.760
 market you choose matters so

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.710
 much and what I've gotten into

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.200
 some public disagreements

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.890
 with people who could be right

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.160
 I mean they these are my

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.920
 friends and people I respect

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:44.340
 but the idea of going after a

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.390
 small niche I think and again

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.240
 maybe people are I don't

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.250
 know the idea of going after

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.610
 small niche is just you're

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.320
 limiting yourself to let's say

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.450
 a pool of 5000-10,000 people

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.030
 well that's like going to a

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.960
 little tiny stream and trying

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.120
 to

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.150
 like scoop up a little bit of

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.930
 water from a tiny stream as

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.920
 opposed to going after a big

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.480
 massive market in motion that's

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.870
 like going to a rushing river

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.400
 and just putting your cup

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.140
 in the river and just like

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.970
 scooping out a and sure you

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.960
 might be able to fill up your

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.450
 cup just you know at a small

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.300
 little stream but the rushing

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.000
 river has so much water that

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.590
 it's a lot easier for a solo

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.480
 bootstrapper to just put their

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.080
 cup in the river and then

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.760
 scoop up a bunch of water and I

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.840
 think sometimes this idea of

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.080
 niche is leads people to the

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.720
 wrong places they're just

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.960
 looking for these tiny streams

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.150
 that no one else has ever

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.800
 discovered

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.970
 before where you know and they

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.870
 say well we got to avoid the

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.040
 big rivers because everyone

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.970
 knows about those yeah but it's

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.750
 a lot easier to get your cup in

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.240
 a big river and scoop up

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.990
 some water than find this tiny

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.800
 little thing that nobody knows

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.840
 exists yeah and the end

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.440
 your cup is bigger than the

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.050
 river exactly yeah I think I

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.680
 wonder if where the kind of

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.190
 disagreement that you have with

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.470
 people about that idea really

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.360
 just comes from like the

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.130
 end goal with what people want

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.600
 to do with their business

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.000
 because basically where I hear

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.530
 kind of what you're saying I

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.100
 guess the opposite of what you

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.570
 say in that you know find a

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:27.920
 niche

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.730
 market the advice that I have

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.680
 typically seen that from is

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.200
 places like why Combinator or

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.500
 startups that are really trying

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.350
 to do like a go big or go home

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.000
 kind of business like

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.450
 I think a good example is Peter

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.080
 Teal the co-founder PayPal his

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.280
 book zero to one I don't know

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:49.600
 if

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.680
 you've heard of that or read it

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.440
 but I mean that's almost his

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.000
 whole thing is basically

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.630
 go for the new markets like

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.210
 that's where you can make

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.120
 really you can there's a lot of

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.450
 opportunity to make a huge

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.770
 business and you know that's

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:03.970
 kind of like what you know

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:04.440
 PayPal

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.510
 Facebook some of those giant

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.510
 companies now did well so yeah

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.240
 if you're if people that

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.910
 are saying that kind of vice

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.800
 are venture capitalists or you

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.610
 know people that that's their

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.400
 goal then

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.020
 I could see that making sense

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.760
 but like you know for bootstrap

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.120
ers I think that is then

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.640
 very dangerous and so maybe I

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.210
 don't know I'm just wondering

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.520
 maybe that's where the

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.120
 disconnect

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.910
 is between those different

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.860
 ideas yeah I think I mean part

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.080
 of it is probably semantics and

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.690
 part of it is this is all

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.990
 really emotional stuff because

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.120
 the way that you are currently

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.300
 doing your thing kind of

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.050
 informs your bias the way that

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.400
 you've achieved success in the

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.900
 past informs your bias I mean I

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.990
 said things at 20 years old

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.200
 that I don't believe anymore

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.070
 I said things that 30 years old

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.610
 that I don't believe anymore

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.040
 and so a lot of this is just

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.110
 you know what where we're at

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.570
 and what's working for us right

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.880
 now and I mean I was on Twitter

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.500
 this guy Evan Golden was saying

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.120
 you can stretch the definition

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.520
 pretty wide it's always easy

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.950
 to justify you know people are

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.280
 spending money oh what did he

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.920
 say he said people are spending

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.470
 money on tacos everywhere so

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.770
 this could justify me in

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.460
 opening a taco stand featuring

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:29.800
 dirt

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.030
 flavored tacos there's lots of

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.260
 evidence people want to talk us

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.240
 and Evan's a friend of mine

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.700
 but these are the kind of

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.680
 arguments I get into on Twitter

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.240
 but I think that unfortunately

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.930
 that's exactly what I do want

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.480
 to do is I want to say is there

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.160
 any evidence in this market

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.270
 of prior demonstrated demand

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.790
 that's just a great word from

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.040
 Corey Gwynne and so PayPal

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.400
 let's take PayPal as an example

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.980
 what was the market for what

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.920
 PayPal was doing before PayPal

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.870
 existed what was massive that

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.100
 the Western Union like bank

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.760
 transfer like you know money

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.650
 transfer market people trying

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.160
 to pay for things with credit

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.880
 cards online but having to go

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.520
 through their credit card

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.360
 processors and there's all

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.400
 sorts of friction but there's

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.560
 tons of evidence

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.420
 that there was billions of

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.690
 dollars being spent in that

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.690
 market already and so it's not

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.160
 like

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.260
 PayPal invented anything I mean

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.830
 sure they created a new way of

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.400
 doing those things but they

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:39.960
 didn't

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.800
 create the market they were

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.550
 riding a wave that already

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.640
 existed they just saw the wave

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.460
 coming and they built a better

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.420
 surfboard that you know enabled

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.880
 them to ride further than

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.990
 anyone else had at the time and

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.100
 this is what I'm talking about

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.000
 is really in some ways

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.390
 what Evan is saying is like I

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:02.510
 am I'm stretching the

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.420
 definition to say is there any

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.480
 sort of

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.590
 prior or existing demonstrated

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:14.780
 demand for this thing and I

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.520
 think you could see that

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.220
 in almost every major product

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.920
 launch like the iPhone before

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.520
 the iPhone was the Blackberry

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.000
 and the Palm and you know you

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.360
 can keep going back and back

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.240
 and back right there's there's

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.070
 demonstrated demand for these

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.480
 things even if you look at I

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.160
 can remember as a kid looking

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.780
 in catalogs wanting to buy a

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.970
 portable television right from

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.840
 Radio Shack or whatever there

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:47.920
 was

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.120
 demand for portable televisions

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.220
 that were battery operated they

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.760
 never worked very well

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.170
 but that there was demonstrated

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.420
 demand for that thing well a

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.080
 big part of the iPhone is

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.710
 just a portable television

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.440
 right that's at least that's

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.040
 how my kids use it that it's

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.200
 like Netflix all day long yeah

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.130
 definitely now so I think the

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.680
 point is to look for some

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.390
 sort of demonstrated demand and

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.730
 and to think is this a market

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.160
 in motion is there evidence

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.230
 that people are doing something

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.720
 about this right now so yeah

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.680
 yeah so the the market is

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.220
 kind of being defined as like a

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.090
 problem to be a solved or like

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.760
 a job to be done rather

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.520
 than I don't know maybe how

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.680
 like marketers sometimes think

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.400
 about markets as almost I

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.080
 feel like they can kind of put

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.690
 into a box of like a specific

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.120
 solution or a specific area

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.120
 in that way so yeah really

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.200
 focusing from what you're

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.780
 saying it sounds like yeah

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.800
 really focusing

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.920
 on the problem that needs to be

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.070
 solved is that a big market of

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.800
 people you know want that

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.990
 you know mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.820
 you yes exactly that's okay

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.040
 that's exactly what I'm talking

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.650
 about that the there's lots you

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.150
 can see this with if you go

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.000
 into product hunt and you find

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.350
 I run into this all the time

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.760
 products that are no longer

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.400
 around there's all these like

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.940
 dead startups oh yeah and in

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.550
 almost every case there just

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.280
 wasn't enough demonstrated

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.560
 demand for that thing they were

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.430
 good ideas they they kind of

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.840
 made sense logically but

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.460
 if you looked at it and go okay

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.110
 but who's doing something about

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.360
 this right now that's

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.280
 really what's most interesting

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.920
 about Derek Reimer story is

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.720
 that once he started talking

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.400
 to the people on his waiting

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.220
 list and asking okay well what

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.680
 are you doing about this

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.320
 problem

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.930
 right now yeah and often their

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.480
 response was well nothing we

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.320
 haven't done anything but

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.170
 you haven't searched on Google

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.790
 for an answer no you haven't

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.680
 searched the slack extension

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.070
 store no well that that's a bad

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.180
 sign if people aren't even

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.040
 willing to do something free

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:17.400
 which

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.480
 is just search for a solution

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.530
 how are you going to convince

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.240
 them to jump over all of

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.880
 these hurdles and actually take

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.250
 out their credit card out of

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.480
 their wallet and pay you

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.070
 for something and this is

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.060
 another thing I've maybe had a

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.520
 hard time to articulate is it

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.880
 takes so much momentum to get

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.540
 someone to take out their

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.280
 credit card that you've got to

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:45.360
 be

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.810
 sure that what you're proposing

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.070
 is something that they really

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.160
 really want and really the

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.930
 only way to to figure that out

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.370
 the only way to see that

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:56.800
 clearly is are they doing

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.520
 something

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.550
 about it right now and is there

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.590
 enough of these people on mass

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.560
 doing this doing something

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.490
 about it right now yeah I love

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.420
 that piece of advice I actually

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.920
 thought that it's I think

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.500
 it was actually you said that

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.080
 like you should go to Twitter

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.470
 and just search search if

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.960
 people

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.890
 are typing something like I don

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.800
't know like maybe even using

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.440
 the derrick rhymer example

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.460
 like search in Twitter for just

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.320
 switching away from slick or

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.120
 switch away from slick and

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.300
 see how many results you

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.640
 actually find and there are a

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.160
 couple I did that for fun but

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.580
 yeah and I mean that's just

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.200
 step one right because it's it

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.360
's pretty low friction to tweet

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.960
 your disappointment with

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.620
 something but at least that's

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.920
 something and then you know you

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.000
 would

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.460
 actually want to talk with

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.130
 folks and ask them questions

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.740
 like okay well what caused you

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:48.880
 to

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.970
 switch how long did you think

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.890
 about switching before it

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.240
 happened what what did you have

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.180
 to do internally in your team

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.180
 to make that switch happen and

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.080
 that's where you're gonna

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.460
 get a lot of answers it's one

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.600
 reasons I I worked for a

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.160
 project management software

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.640
 startup

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.200
 and what I didn't know before I

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.690
 joined is how hard it is to get

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:12.120
 people to switch project

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.590
 management software and it's

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.650
 remarkably difficult because

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.970
 everybody has an opinion on the

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:19.400
 team

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.390
 right the developers one thing

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.230
 the marketing folks want one

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.080
 another thing the CTO wants

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.020
 one thing like it goes around

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.870
 and around and so you have to

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.920
 convince not just one person

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.840
 but ten twenty people to to

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.270
 make this decision and then the

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.400
 the other kind of bad sign so

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.410
 despite how difficult it is to

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.400
 get people to switch people do

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.000
 switch all the time and

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.250
 that's also a bad sign because

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.570
 they don't just switch once and

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.640
 then they're satisfied

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.380
 they switch they try charlo and

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.060
 then they're like no this didn

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.480
't work and then they try

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.910
 base camp and then like oh that

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.330
 doesn't work and then they try

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:58.480
 Jira like they all end up

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.350
 in Jira right that's how it

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.880
 works yeah and so you know when

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.680
 you actually get into those

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.880
 real discussions with people

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.600
 about what is the actual

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.960
 process look like even you know

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.870
 a market like project

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:22.730
 management it has its own its

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.080
 own minefield right like there

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:25.080
's

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.040
 pros and cons and I think for

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.280
 bootstrapers it's a lot harder

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.080
 it's why we've seen you

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.640
 know base camp got in early and

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.490
 so they've done okay but really

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:36.840
 besides base camp everybody

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.160
 else is venture funded because

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.310
 you it just costs so much money

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.960
 and if you get on their

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.830
 list like people they Jira will

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.700
 call you they will like they've

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.280
 got sales people that want

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.200
 to onboard you right because

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.120
 they know the only way to push

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.160
 this through the whole funnel

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.790
 is to have a lot of kind of

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.040
 concerted effort doing it so a

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.040
 lot of these things a lot of

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.280
 these decisions depend on

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.730
 whether or not you're bootstra

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.080
pping whether or not you're

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.220
 bootstrapping as a solo founder

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.640
 because some of these ideas and

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.080
 markets are just harder

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.360
 to reach as a bootstrapper or

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.940
 solo founder right so with that

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.800
 like in mind and you know

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.480
 starting with the market I

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.090
 guess and maybe some ways what

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.680
 sounds like what you'd say

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.000
 is basically start with the

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.420
 market filter like that's the

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.760
 first filter that you want

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.590
 to put on of how to basically

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.400
 choose what problem you're

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.240
 going to solve how you're going

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.870
 to do it how do you like it

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:44.380
 seems like you know you start

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.400
 talking to customers start

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.840
 talking to users it takes a

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.380
 while before you can really

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.120
 know what's the right approach

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.470
 what's the right solution to

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.790
 actually build what do you do

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.360
 if that solution ends up being

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.200
 something that isn't something

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.780
 that a bootstrapper can do or

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.260
 it's or it's or maybe it's a

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.000
 solution

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.050
 that doesn't use your strengths

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.700
 you know as a as a founder it

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.320
 doesn't use your skills

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.110
 your abilities so how do you

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.550
 handle that when I guess

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.190
 starting with a market because

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.280
 yeah

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.300
 I mean I guess it in some ways

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.420
 it kind of goes back to there's

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.360
 just all these filters

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.560
 and in some ways all these

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.970
 things have to align which is

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:24.720
 obviously very hard yeah I mean

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.120
 I think that's just the this is

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.660
 another unpopular tweet of mine

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.440
 but it is just and I had to

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.370
 I had to admit this before I

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.380
 had any success but what you

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.520
 kind of have to admit in some

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.030
 way on one side is we're not

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.640
 all going to make it and a lot

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.480
 of people don't like hearing

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.150
 that but we're not all going to

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.550
 make it that there's no way

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.080
 that every single aspiring

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.600
 entrepreneur

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.780
 in the world can apply all of

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.830
 these filters and come out on

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.680
 the other side and by the

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.600
 way even if you come out on the

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.840
 other side and you know like I

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.480
 have a business now that's

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.710
 doing pretty well it could

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.350
 disappear tomorrow every day I

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:15.960
 wake up going well maybe today

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.000
's

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.530
 the day it disappears right

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.950
 because markets change and they

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.200
 can change really fast and

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.200
 so there's there's no like

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.760
 there's nothing really romantic

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.840
 about starting a business

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.520
 it's just there's all sorts of

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.000
 things that have to align for

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.040
 it to work and a lot of

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.560
 us aren't going to make it so

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.980
 you have to hold you have to

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.040
 hold that on one side well

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.580
 at the same time on the other

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.370
 side these things are intention

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.000
 on the other side you have to

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.420
 be super optimistic that you're

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.620
 going to make it and that you

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.440
're just going to keep trying

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.380
 because the other thing I've

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.360
 seen anecdotally I don't know

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.320
 if this is scientific but the

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.630
 people who keep trying who keep

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.790
 working at it who keep pushing

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.560
 that ball forward many

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.720
 of them do make it and so there

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.110
's a there's a little bit of how

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.520
 long can you last how

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.580
 long can you try it's why a lot

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.750
 of successful entrepreneurs

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.160
 actually tend to be

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.240
 statistically

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.450
 older because by that point in

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.590
 your life you've had a bunch of

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.640
 industry experience so you

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.370
 know what an industry is you

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.310
 know you've got connections in

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.040
 that industry you've seen

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.120
 the pain points you've seen how

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.070
 they spend money you know there

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.580
's all of this accrued

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:41.550
 experience that ends up being

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:45.020
 helpful and you know time is

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.120
 kind of what allows you to

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.140
 keep pushing right so it's not

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.000
 saying you shouldn't try in

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.040
 your 20s but because you

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.790
 could it could all align right

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:57.490
 my friend Nathan Barry is not

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.440
 even 30 yet and has already

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.000
 achieved

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.960
 more as a founder than a lot of

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.020
 folks but I think you have to

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.080
 have this idea of well it

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.430
 might not happen but I'm going

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.840
 to try and this might be a 10

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.120
 year project or this might

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.000
 be a 20 year project and you

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.920
 almost have to be okay with

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.440
 that like this just might take

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.740
 time for everything to align

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.130
 and the whole time I'm going to

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.040
 have to be working as if

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.380
 this will eventually work out

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.070
 and not just doing the same

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.040
 thing putting yourself in

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.730
 new circles getting outside of

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.660
 your comfort zone I've

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.420
 described this before as is it

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.080
 command

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.300
 and conquer that uses fog of

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.580
 war where you're just on a map

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.890
 and everything's dark and you

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:44.160
're

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.010
 exploring it yeah yeah so if

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.650
 you think about that as a

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.570
 metaphor like when you start

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:49.920
 out

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.630
 you're just in that map and all

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.230
 you can see is around you right

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.560
 and as you explore more

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.540
 of the map more and more parts

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.830
 become illuminated and every

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.670
 once in a while you'll end up

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680
 in

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.950
 a spot of the map where things

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.360
 just happen right like you get

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.240
 a bunch of bounty or you

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.880
 run into a bunch of enemies or

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.920
 whatever and it's kind of like

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.040
 that like you're walking

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.060
 around for me for example I was

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.590
 walking around and I just

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.610
 happened to run into Adam Wath

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:22.960
en

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.120
 who I had no idea who he was or

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.710
 anything about him but he ended

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.080
 up being quite an influential

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.450
 person in the Laravel community

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.640
 and that was just me wandering

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.560
 around the map and hit him

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.960
 wandering around the map too

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.460
 and then us meeting each other

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.920
 and once once I could see like

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.240
 I've learned tons about a lot

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.840
 of my thoughts about like

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.640
 choosing a market first have

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.080
 been

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.060
 because of the influence of the

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.570
 Laravel community and looking

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.160
 at Taylor and Adam Wathen and

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.490
 Steve Shogar and Jeffrey Wei

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:03.780
 build these crazy businesses

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.920
 because in my little world

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.240
 before

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.450
 I met them you know this is the

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.610
 way things were done people

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.680
 like us do things like this

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.290
 and then I got over into that

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.180
 area of the map and it was like

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.600
 this whole new world opened

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.360
 up that I'd never seen before

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.340
 and without that world opening

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.840
 up I don't think I would

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.580
 have well I don't think a lot

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.820
 of things would have happened

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.960
 and so there's clearly you have

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.260
 to kind of be always doing

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.840
 things trying things getting

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.410
 out of your comfort zone

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:38.720
 meeting new

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.510
 people and I think the advice I

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.770
 would give my kids is just to

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.760
 explore as much of the

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.380
 map as you can as early as you

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.320
 can because the more

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.940
 exploration you do I think I

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.720
 stayed

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.770
 too local too long you know I

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.410
 grew up in this small little

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:59.280
 farming town in Alberta and

00:39:59.280 --> 00:39:59.400
 then

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.550
 the big city was Edmonton and I

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.720
 just spent too much time there

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.360
 and then you know like

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.920
 the first time I flew into New

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.020
 York I was like holy shit like

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.000
 there's a lot of people

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.230
 here there's a lot of money

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.470
 here there's a lot of

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.800
 businesses here that I've never

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.740
 even

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.990
 imagined before and it kind of

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.150
 expanded my whole world view

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.120
 and unless you're doing that

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.380
 work to kind of walk around the

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.830
 map and discover new areas yeah

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.640
 I think it'll be harder to

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.890
 you know to find those markets

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.920
 to find those ideas.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.820
 So I want to go back a little

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.910
 bit to something you said you

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:45.200
 know kind of talking about how

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.700
 basically this might not work

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.800
 for all of us and it's very

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.120
 hard and yeah we all might not

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.360
 make it through and that's just

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.460
 kind of the truth of it so like

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.120
 how do you and I'm just

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.230
 curious about your situation

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.260
 like how do you go to your wife

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.520
 with that and get her on board

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.630
 for this whole journey of what

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.660
 we're trying to do because so

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.400
 that's I'm just curious

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.970
 because that's definitely

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.650
 something I know me and my wife

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.400
 struggle with a lot just with

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.090
 my last thing and like it is

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:18.780
 hard so it's like it's you know

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.440
 you it's not just you going

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.730
 on this journey you're bringing

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.000
 your whole family with you.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.420
 Yeah I mean again you probably

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.650
 don't want to look at the

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.160
 statistics the statistics are

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.160
 pretty bad.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.160
 Just don't look.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.850
 So this podcast has been titled

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.120
 unpopular opinions.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120
 Unpopular opinions.

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.120
 That's the joke.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.210
 I mean it's just like if you

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.760
 want the reality the reality is

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.040
 not good statistically.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.310
 I mean clearly I think I think

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:48.640
 all entrepreneurs have this

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.140
 feeling that maybe they can do

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:51.280
 it

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.170
 better than the next guy and

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.370
 because statistically you know

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.070
 millions of people start

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.960
 businesses

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.850
 but those people are in all

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.820
 sorts of different places have

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.000
 all sorts of different leverage

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.780
 have all sorts of different

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.590
 privilege you know there's

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.680
 there's all these factors that

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.770
 go into you know why a person

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.770
 becomes a successor not and I

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.110
 think every entrepreneur feels

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:16.400
 like

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.670
 they've got some secret sauce

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.930
 that'll make them better than

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.200
 the next guy.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.200
 Oh yeah.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.810
 But I mean in my early 20s I

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.200
 started a couple retail shops

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.560
 that ended up losing a lot of

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.530
 money and that was hard to

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.840
 recover from as a family.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.070
 And so that that is just part

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:41.290
 of it like if you're going to

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:42.480
 be on that.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.960
 So that was almost 20 years ago

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.360
.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.700
 And yeah so now I'm at a place

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.610
 where you know maybe I've

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.090
 learned enough lessons that I

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:53.120
've

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.750
 made enough connections that

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.160
 things are happening.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.120
 But that's a long journey.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.920
 That's 10 20 years of of work.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.570
 And so yeah I mean I think that

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.550
's something you got to consider

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.680
 with kind of with everything.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.120
 I don't think you should kill

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.520
 yourself in the process.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.090
 I think I think I worked

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:18.410
 probably too hard a lot of

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.200
 those years when I didn't need

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:20.440
 to

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.290
 it's just wasted cycles trying

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.310
 to make something happen you

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.060
 know you're you're it's far

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:26.440
 better

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.250
 for you to book a ticket to a

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.440
 conference that you've never

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.480
 been to then to work 60 70

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.880
 80 hours a week.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.630
 Because at least for me that

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.700
 the biggest jumps forward have

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.440
 been because I met somebody

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.080
 outside of my circle.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.870
 I met John Buddha my co-founder

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.670
 in 2014 at this kind of

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.520
 experimental technology art

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:52.960
 design

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.880
 festival called XOXO.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.930
 And you know I wasn't going to

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.200
 go initially.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.250
 I had to kind of push myself to

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.860
 get out of the house and

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.080
 actually go.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.320
 So yeah I don't think there's

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.440
 any easy answers there.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.580
 I think you can't stare step

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.560
 your way up.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.590
 You can do something small on

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:15.530
 the side and then see if that

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:17.840
 evolves into something bigger

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.770
 and then something bigger and

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:21.520
 then something bigger.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.400
 Nathan Barry just wrote a piece

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.220
 on this that I don't fully like

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.320
 or agree with.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.520
 But maybe I don't like it just

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.840
 because it's the hard truth.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.080
 He talks about a series of lad

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.210
ders and you know the first

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.320
 ladder is just like trading

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.010
 time for money and then you

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.710
 kind of work up that ladder

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.360
 right.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.210
 You can work yourself up from

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.820
 making minimum wage up to

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.840
 making more money per hour.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.610
 But then you go to the next

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:50.830
 ladder which has higher earning

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.920
 potential but it's harder.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.530
 It's just like OK now you've

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.290
 got to you're trading time for

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:57.800
 money but it's more on your

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.580
 terms like consulting and so

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.660
 then you work your way up that

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.360
 level.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.920
 And then there's another ladder

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.300
 and you know these keep going

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.760
 and the difficulty with each

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.430
 ladder goes up and but your

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:14.560
 potential in his case he's just

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.600
 talking about income earning

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.600
 potential your income earning

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.480
 potential goes up as well.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.880
 And it is a little bit of a

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.560
 stair step right like you're

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.190
 moving your way up here and

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.400
 then

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.680
 you're like oh well there's

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.170
 opportunity over here so then

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.080
 you might take a few steps back

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.630
 to start here and then build

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:33.840
 yourself up here.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.860
 And then you look at the next

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.840
 ladder you go there's more

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.960
 opportunity over there so then

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.910
 you go back down and then work

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.920
 your way up.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.600
 Yeah that's all possible.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.940
 Money helps if you have in

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.620
 terms of like having a decent

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.400
 life it helps if you have a lot

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:54.600
 more

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.420
 cash saved up the more cash you

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.020
 have saved up the less stress

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:02.360
 you have but that's not

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.040
 always possible either right.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.920
 So that the only way I can

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.950
 think of to alleviate the

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.580
 stress is to have very low cost

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.840
 of living

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:20.000
 and or a lot of money saved up.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.470
 Money that you can risk that

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.920
 you wouldn't feel bad about

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.960
 losing.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.290
 So and you can even hear this

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.510
 in John and I's podcast you

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.080
 know he was working for Cards

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.020
 Against Humanity when we

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.160
 started this and he also had

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.480
 more money saved up than I did

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.680
 and so my stress level when we

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.080
 weren't quite yet full time yet

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.640
 was a lot higher.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.320
 I'm just like oh god like do we

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.050
 got to take investment we got

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.560
 to try to add three or four

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.630
 more things on top of this to

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.000
 make this work.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.420
 You can see how like

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.310
 desperation affects your

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.560
 actions and a lot of businesses

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.320
 you'll see

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.700
 do this like one thing's not

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.140
 working quite enough so then

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.560
 they add another thing to

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.040
 hopefully

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.130
 bring up in more income and

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:07.210
 that's not quite bringing

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:08.120
 enough so they add another

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:08.560
 thing and

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.780
 they just keep adding more and

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.410
 more stuff and more and more

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.200
 stress to their lives.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.320
 But yeah for John it's easy he

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.330
's got no dependence and his

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:23.040
 cost of living is low and he

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:23.560
 had a

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.280
 bunch of money saved up.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.600
 For him this isn't making or

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.880
 break it it's like no I can

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.880
 just if this doesn't work I'm

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.440
 fine so that if you want to

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.240
 make it easier I think lower

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.360
 your expenses and save a bunch

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.780
 of money or get someone to give

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.020
 you a bunch of money or rob a

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:47.840
 bank or whatever.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.480
 Yeah go the easier route.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.040
 I mean this is why privilege

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.460
 plays such a big part in

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.190
 business like some people do

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.440
 they

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.180
 get a they have a big trust

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.040
 fund and they get a bunch of

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.600
 money it does help.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.600
 Yeah I agree.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.880
 Yeah that makes sense.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.890
 So maybe as a last question we

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.810
 could end with maybe you've

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:10.960
 heard how I built this podcast

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.100
 they always end with an

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.670
 interesting question which is

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:15.180
 so for you I'm just interested

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:15.360
 in

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.020
 hearing as well like with

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.770
 transistor like where you guys

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:20.360
 gotten so far how much do you

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.300
 think of that was luck and how

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.200
 much of it was you know you and

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.960
 John's skill and talents

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.840
 and hard work.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.130
 It's definitely the

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.500
 accumulation of a lifetime of

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.840
 experience and I think I think

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.560
 your attitude

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.500
 matters a lot in that right

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.320
 like are you going to keep

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.600
 going out and trying things are

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.000
 you

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.130
 going to keep going out and

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:47.470
 trying to push the envelope are

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:48.880
 you going to keep going out

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.530
 and put things out in public

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.000
 are you going to go out and

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.760
 meet people like if you were

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.400
 going to split test my life and

00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.840
 you put one Justin in his room

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.160
 and he never leaves and

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.050
 all he does is play Sonic the H

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:04.640
edgehog forever and then you

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.200
 have another version where he's

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.090
 like always going out and

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.520
 trying to figure things out and

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.440
 trying to build things and

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.510
 trying to write and trying to

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.600
 meet this person and for sure

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.320
 in that A/B test you know

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:19.920
 Justin

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.910
 B wins there's I don't think it

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.870
's that's a it's not too

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:29.440
 difficult to see that so yeah

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.400
 there's a lot of luck and where

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.060
 I was born and but you're the

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.480
 the the influence of luck

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.080
 starts to go down a lot like

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.650
 the the the influence of blind

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.140
 luck like just like where you

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:48.280
 were

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.620
 born like what what year and

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.560
 country and location and

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.080
 parents you were born to after

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.240
 that part

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.290
 you make your most of your luck

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:02.320
 just by whatever attitude you

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.080
 have every day there's still

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.080
 some privilege that comes with

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.800
 where you were born but most of

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.440
 that kind of built in luck

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.780
 is already happened by the time

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.440
