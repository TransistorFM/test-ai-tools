 I'm Noah and I'm Ben and you're
 listening to Product Journey.
 Hi folks, today we got Justin
 Jackson on the podcast.
 He is the co-founder of Trans
istor, which is a podcasting
 hosting company.
 He's also the founder of MegaM
aker, a community for founders
 and of course, avid podcast
 lover
 and listener.
 Hi Justin.
 Hey, how's it going?
 It's nice to be here.
 Thanks for coming on Justin.
 I listen to the show every week
 so it's fun to finally talk to
 people that you only hear
 talking to you.
 Yes, same actually.
 Yeah.
 Stuck to have you.
 Yeah, we can kind of finally
 make this one by one connection
.
 Now we can just like talk
 actually together instead of, "
Oh you listen then I'll listen."
 Yeah, totally.
 It's funny also because I've
 seen Ben before.
 We've never talked, but I had
 to come up with a vision in my
 head of what Noah looked like
 and now I can actually see.
 Oh that's good.
 For the rest of the listeners
 at home, they don't know yet,
 but now I know.
 I'm a part of the secret club.
 Yeah was it what you expected?
 Well usually, I've been podcast
ing since 2012 and usually I'm
 the disappointment when people
 meet me in person.
 They go, "I thought you'd be a
 lot taller."
 Yeah, I feel like that always
 happens when you hear someone's
 voice.
 If it's deeper, you kind of
 depict a certain kind of person
 in your mind or if it's, yeah,
 it just depends on the voice
 and then usually it's always
 ignored what you're thinking.
 Yeah.
 See if I had to guess, I'd
 guess that Noah is about six
 feet tall and I'm going to
 guess
 Ben is about the same height as
 me.
 I'm five foot eight.
 How did I do?
 So you're pretty good.
 I'm six foot three.
 Okay.
 I'm trying to calculate
 centimeters to foot right now.
 Oh yeah.
 See this is the weird Canadian
 thing is that we use the metric
 system, but we are so close
 to the US that we end up doing
 measurements in inches.
 So I'm almost exactly six foot
 tall.
 Oh, you're almost exactly six
 feet.
 Okay.
 See now everybody knows,
 everybody's just adjusted.
 You may know mine.
 Maybe you should just attach
 images to the show notes so
 photos of us.
 I think every podcast show
 notes needs to have stats on
 people.
 Noah, six foot three.
 Ben.
 Yeah.
 60, how many centimeters is
 that?
 It's 185 or 186.
 185 centimeters.
 Yeah.
 Give people some stats.
 That's what they want to hear.
 Blue eyes, dark, blondish,
 pretty blonde hair.
 Form a picture.
 So yeah, so we're glad to have
 you on the show, Justin.
 Two topics that we're kind of
 interested in that I know you
 talk a decent amount about
 is like audience building and
 like your market and starting
 with a market instead of an
 idea.
 So we kind of wanted to jump
 into both those two topics and
 just kind of dig deeper into
 that.
 Perfect.
 It's like my favorite thing to
 talk about right now.
 Yeah.
 I think some people are getting
 sick of me talking about it,
 but I just can't stop thinking
 about it.
 So it's what naturally kind of
 comes out.
 And actually, we had a question
 about that kind of like with
 building an audience.
 That was one of the things we
're interested in.
 Do you ever feel like you run
 out of new things to say?
 I mean, one thing that's been
 helpful for me is that since
 2013, we've had this online
 community with Mega Maker.
 And so people are interacting
 and asking questions all the
 time.
 And those discussions often
 inspire my thinking of, oh,
 wait a second.
 It's actually like a lot of my
 tweets come out of
 conversations that I've had
 inside
 of Mega Maker or things I'm
 listening to on a podcast or
 even things I've read in a book
.
 You know, I'm reading something
.
 It brings up these thoughts.
 And I treat Twitter kind of
 like the local comedy club, you
 know, where you go and test
 out material.
 And she's like, OK, I'm going
 to try this out and see how it
 lands.
 And it's also just a helpful
 way for me to process my
 thinking.
 So no, I haven't run out of
 things to talk about yet.
 I do have moments like John and
 I are doing our podcast now.
 And I think we're ready for the
 year to be done in some ways,
 you know, like ready for
 things to kind of wind down.
 And so I think there's such
 thing as fatigue when you're
 publishing something every week
 and you eventually need to give
 your brain space to just
 explore, you know, other things
 and have other ideas.
 But yeah, not most of the time,
 as long as I'm interacting with
 people and real life
 situations and also doing
 experiments in my own life, I
 don't have run out of anything
 to say yet.
 Yeah, I could see the fatigue
 in that, like, you feel like
 you're you have to have
 something
 to say, like at least every
 week when you have the podcast,
 like you have to have a new
 thing that you're thinking
 about or that you can dive into
.
 Yeah, we've definitely kind of
 seen that.
 I think this is what that's why
 breaks are important.
 I almost get this more with
 because podcasting, you can
 just turn on the mics and if
 you
 have a rough idea of where you
 want to go, you can talk it out
.
 But writing, I find is a lot
 more takes a lot more of my
 energy.
 And so like writing that weekly
 newsletter that I write is
 there are definitely weeks
 where that is tough.
 Not because I don't have an
 idea, but sometimes to process
 ideas and actually write it in
 a way that makes sense is hard.
 But yeah, in either case,
 breaks are good.
 I can't always say I'm
 receiving that newsletter and
 you're doing pretty good, I
 guess.
 At least I'm enjoying it.
 That almost gives me more
 pressure because then I'm like,
 "Oh, I like it.
 I got to keep going."
 Yeah.
 When that came down now.
 In that case, I hated it every
 time.
 So we got a couple of questions
 about audience and I think I
 have a pretty interesting one
 that is what makes a good
 audience and do you think that
 you should like, do you think
 you have to be part of your
 audience?
 Do you have to feel comfortable
 among the people?
 So I've actually changed my
 tune a little bit on this.
 I think now if you're starting
 a business, the market is the
 most important thing, the
 market you choose.
 And when I say market, I don't
 mean market as in just a ident
ifiable group of people.
 I'm talking about a group of
 people that buys X. So the
 diamond market last year was 4.
5
 billion or something like that.
 To me, that's a market.
 It's a market where you can see
 people in motion preferably
 buying something, but sometimes
 it's just people in motion
 doing something.
 And everything kind of hinges
 on that which market you are in
.
 So as an example, Taylor Ott
well is the founder of Laravel,
 which is the most popular PHP
 programming framework in the
 world.
 He has a huge audience.
 If you look at his audience,
 quote unquote, on Twitter, he's
 got hundreds of thousands
 of followers.
 Let's just check because I don
't want people to be.
 So Ottwell, he has 82,000
 followers on Twitter.
 So for a lot of people, that
 would be a big audience.
 And if you go to LaraCon, you
 see he's got 800 people in the
 audience.
 And he has tons of people
 buying his stuff.
 He has millions of people using
 Laravel.
 But all of that is in the
 context of a bigger market.
 It's hard to count the number
 of programmers in the world,
 but let's just say a reasonable
 estimate is that there's 5
 million PHP programmers in the
 world.
 Would you agree with that, Ben?
 Yeah, definitely.
 I've actually used Laravel for
 a couple of projects.
 Okay, there you go.
 And so 5 million PHP
 programmers in the world.
 And let's just take one element
 of that market, not including
 all the tools they buy, not
 including everything else that
 you need to be a programmer.
 Let's just think about salary.
 And these are just guesses.
 But let's say on average, an
 average PHP programmer in the
 world makes $25,000 a year.
 Well 25,000 times 5 million is
 $125 billion, I think.
 That's $125 billion being spent
 on salaries for PHP developers
 alone.
 That's a massive market.
 It's not just a big group of
 people, but it's also a big
 group of people where there's
 some
 sort of economic activity being
 generated.
 I think it's why products in
 the Laravel community often
 have a magnified impact
 compared to other
 things.
 So, I have a course called
 Marketing for Developers that
 did pretty good.
 That's like if you take all of
 the developers in the world and
 then you ask how many of
 those developers want to learn
 marketing, it's a much smaller
 slice, right?
 How many developers in the
 world are PHP developers that
 want to make their jobs better?
 Well that's probably 5 million.
 And so you can compare results
 and you can see that kind of
 everything hinges on the
 market.
 How big your audience can be
 within that market and then all
 the multiples all kind of
 depend
 on that.
 So, how much money is being
 spent in that market already
 and how much of that can you
 carve off for yourself?
 Taylor, presumably, he's only
 carved off a little bit of the
 PHP market.
 There's still other frameworks.
 There's still programmers that
 don't know or use Laravel.
 So, he's still got plenty of
 room to grow as well.
 But even then, Taylor Ottwell
 as a solo person has sold $10
 million worth of software to
 PHP developers.
 That's pretty crazy.
 That's insane.
 And he just recently took on
 employees.
 So, there's funded startups in
 San Francisco right now that
 have millions of dollars in
 funding, staff of 50 people and
 they haven't sold $10 million
 worth of software.
 I think the market that you're
 in determines everything.
 And when you have what Corey G
wynn calls demonstrated demand,
 so you can actually see the
 demand
 that's kind of what you're
 looking for.
 You're looking for people in
 motion, a large group of people
 in motion who are where there's
 economic activity being
 generated from whatever they're
 doing.
 So, you would basically say
 start out with the market, try
 to find a market that you
 want to work in and then start
 building an audience around
 that.
 Don't worry as much about do
 you feel comfortable in that
 audience or those kind of
 things.
 I mean, this is where it gets
 tricky.
 This is why business is so hard
 because you apply all of these
 filters to get to where
 you want to go.
 So, it's not enough to just be
 in a good market.
 You actually have to be
 interested in that market.
 You have to have good founder
 market fit.
 You have to then be able to
 identify some sort of need in
 that market.
 You have to actually execute on
 some things and make some sort
 of connection.
 I don't think you have to
 necessarily build an audience.
 But you get a lot of leverage
 from who you know and who knows
 you.
 Who you know is just making
 connections.
 We're making connections right
 now.
 Now the three of us know each
 other.
 Even the fact that we've been
 on a phone call makes it a lot
 easier for me to ask a favor
 of you in the future or for you
 to ask a favor of me.
 That's networking.
 That's who you know.
 Who knows you is the audience
 effect.
 That could be very helpful.
 But there are people who have
 built businesses without doing
 that.
 Ruben Gammes is a good example
 of someone who's just built a
 software business almost purely
 on search engine results and
 optimizing search engine
 results.
 I think it's one of the levers
 you can use.
 I think without any sort of
 human connection it's very
 difficult.
 So you do have to connect with
 other human beings.
 This is why it's helpful to be
 interested in the market you're
 in.
 Sometimes it can even that can
 be enough.
 I'm really interested in the
 Laravel community.
 I'm not really a Laravel
 developer but I've spoken at
 their conference three times.
 I really like the people and I
 would say I'm part of the
 community even though I'm not
 like a power user of Laravel.
 There has to be something that
 draws you to that market.
 There has to be something that
 keeps you there and you're
 probably going to need some
 sort
 of connection with some key
 people in that market to make
 it work.
 How you get there is kind of
 the individual journey.
 I'm almost 40 now.
 It's very difficult to say what
 are the 10 steps that brought
 you to transistor because
 it's like layer on layer on
 layer of my life going back to
 when I was a kid.
 And so all of those steps up
 till now lead me to where I'm
 at now.
 I think you can optimize for
 some of those things like where
 you point yourself in life
 has a big determination of
 where you'll end up.
 I think the connections you
 make matter a lot.
 I think what you put out into
 the world matters a lot.
 So podcasting, blogging, public
 speaking, but even just
 anything not open source
 projects,
 anything you put out into the
 world can help.
 But in terms of like adding all
 those up and going OK what
 really matters a lot harder to
 figure that out.
 Yeah, I think that's a pretty
 interesting point because when
 we started out with a podcast
 I think we were both on the
 track of we should build an
 audience.
 And it's kind of like we're
 shifting away from that a
 little bit.
 And just recently came across
 this tweet from Jane Portman
 and I think Rob Walling, Jane
 Portman from UserList who were
 also talking about that, like
 how they didn't really need
 an audience.
 But basically it just fits very
 well to what you just said I
 guess.
 And there's one more thing that
 I would like to get your
 opinion on because you're
 probably
 familiar with Derek Reimer and
 what happened with Level, right
?
 It's kind of like do you feel
 like having an audience might
 not always be not necessary
 but also maybe lead to false
 positives?
 Oh definitely, yeah.
 And it can be really helpful
 too.
 There's to say that my audience
 didn't help in launching Trans
istor would be disingenuous.
 Like that it definitely helped.
 It still helps.
 But there is a risk because
 what you're looking for is you
're looking for some sort of
 momentum,
 right?
 And when you launch something
 you're trying to gauge what
 kind of response is this
 getting.
 So when Apple releases the new
 iPhone how many people are
 lined up outside of the Apple
 store, right?
 Now this Apple actually can
 fall prey to this because they
've got all these mega fans,
 right?
 That are going to line up day
 one no matter what.
 So you could see these huge
 lineups and you could go oh wow
 like the new iPhone is a big
 success but unless the rest of
 the world shows up then it's
 not going to be a success,
 right?
 So yeah that's a pretty good
 analogy.
 Yeah lineups on day one I mean
 they are helpful but they can
 also you know like I've
 launched
 things I think still to this
 day my best launch ever was for
 this I was doing this online
 series on product marketing and
 like the first couple weeks
 tons of people showed up and
 when I started asking them what
 are you hoping to achieve you
 know out of this what brought
 you here they said oh I'm just
 a big fan I just get everything
 that you put out and
 that's nice but it became
 really clear in the coming
 months that no one else cared
 and
 that's the disadvantage of
 having an audience when people
 are really kind of invested in
 your journey they're going to
 show up no matter what they're
 going to show up just because
 they have a personal connection
 to you but ultimately if you're
 going to run a business
 you need people who are going
 to show up and then more people
 who are going to show up
 and then more people are going
 to show up right and this is
 actually why I think the
 market you choose matters so
 much and what I've gotten into
 some public disagreements
 with people who could be right
 I mean they these are my
 friends and people I respect
 but the idea of going after a
 small niche I think and again
 maybe people are I don't
 know the idea of going after
 small niche is just you're
 limiting yourself to let's say
 a pool of 5000-10,000 people
 well that's like going to a
 little tiny stream and trying
 to
 like scoop up a little bit of
 water from a tiny stream as
 opposed to going after a big
 massive market in motion that's
 like going to a rushing river
 and just putting your cup
 in the river and just like
 scooping out a and sure you
 might be able to fill up your
 cup just you know at a small
 little stream but the rushing
 river has so much water that
 it's a lot easier for a solo
 bootstrapper to just put their
 cup in the river and then
 scoop up a bunch of water and I
 think sometimes this idea of
 niche is leads people to the
 wrong places they're just
 looking for these tiny streams
 that no one else has ever
 discovered
 before where you know and they
 say well we got to avoid the
 big rivers because everyone
 knows about those yeah but it's
 a lot easier to get your cup in
 a big river and scoop up
 some water than find this tiny
 little thing that nobody knows
 exists yeah and the end
 your cup is bigger than the
 river exactly yeah I think I
 wonder if where the kind of
 disagreement that you have with
 people about that idea really
 just comes from like the
 end goal with what people want
 to do with their business
 because basically where I hear
 kind of what you're saying I
 guess the opposite of what you
 say in that you know find a
 niche
 market the advice that I have
 typically seen that from is
 places like why Combinator or
 startups that are really trying
 to do like a go big or go home
 kind of business like
 I think a good example is Peter
 Teal the co-founder PayPal his
 book zero to one I don't know
 if
 you've heard of that or read it
 but I mean that's almost his
 whole thing is basically
 go for the new markets like
 that's where you can make
 really you can there's a lot of
 opportunity to make a huge
 business and you know that's
 kind of like what you know
 PayPal
 Facebook some of those giant
 companies now did well so yeah
 if you're if people that
 are saying that kind of vice
 are venture capitalists or you
 know people that that's their
 goal then
 I could see that making sense
 but like you know for bootstrap
ers I think that is then
 very dangerous and so maybe I
 don't know I'm just wondering
 maybe that's where the
 disconnect
 is between those different
 ideas yeah I think I mean part
 of it is probably semantics and
 part of it is this is all
 really emotional stuff because
 the way that you are currently
 doing your thing kind of
 informs your bias the way that
 you've achieved success in the
 past informs your bias I mean I
 said things at 20 years old
 that I don't believe anymore
 I said things that 30 years old
 that I don't believe anymore
 and so a lot of this is just
 you know what where we're at
 and what's working for us right
 now and I mean I was on Twitter
 this guy Evan Golden was saying
 you can stretch the definition
 pretty wide it's always easy
 to justify you know people are
 spending money oh what did he
 say he said people are spending
 money on tacos everywhere so
 this could justify me in
 opening a taco stand featuring
 dirt
 flavored tacos there's lots of
 evidence people want to talk us
 and Evan's a friend of mine
 but these are the kind of
 arguments I get into on Twitter
 but I think that unfortunately
 that's exactly what I do want
 to do is I want to say is there
 any evidence in this market
 of prior demonstrated demand
 that's just a great word from
 Corey Gwynne and so PayPal
 let's take PayPal as an example
 what was the market for what
 PayPal was doing before PayPal
 existed what was massive that
 the Western Union like bank
 transfer like you know money
 transfer market people trying
 to pay for things with credit
 cards online but having to go
 through their credit card
 processors and there's all
 sorts of friction but there's
 tons of evidence
 that there was billions of
 dollars being spent in that
 market already and so it's not
 like
 PayPal invented anything I mean
 sure they created a new way of
 doing those things but they
 didn't
 create the market they were
 riding a wave that already
 existed they just saw the wave
 coming and they built a better
 surfboard that you know enabled
 them to ride further than
 anyone else had at the time and
 this is what I'm talking about
 is really in some ways
 what Evan is saying is like I
 am I'm stretching the
 definition to say is there any
 sort of
 prior or existing demonstrated
 demand for this thing and I
 think you could see that
 in almost every major product
 launch like the iPhone before
 the iPhone was the Blackberry
 and the Palm and you know you
 can keep going back and back
 and back right there's there's
 demonstrated demand for these
 things even if you look at I
 can remember as a kid looking
 in catalogs wanting to buy a
 portable television right from
 Radio Shack or whatever there
 was
 demand for portable televisions
 that were battery operated they
 never worked very well
 but that there was demonstrated
 demand for that thing well a
 big part of the iPhone is
 just a portable television
 right that's at least that's
 how my kids use it that it's
 like Netflix all day long yeah
 definitely now so I think the
 point is to look for some
 sort of demonstrated demand and
 and to think is this a market
 in motion is there evidence
 that people are doing something
 about this right now so yeah
 yeah so the the market is
 kind of being defined as like a
 problem to be a solved or like
 a job to be done rather
 than I don't know maybe how
 like marketers sometimes think
 about markets as almost I
 feel like they can kind of put
 into a box of like a specific
 solution or a specific area
 in that way so yeah really
 focusing from what you're
 saying it sounds like yeah
 really focusing
 on the problem that needs to be
 solved is that a big market of
 people you know want that
 you know mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah
 you yes exactly that's okay
 that's exactly what I'm talking
 about that the there's lots you
 can see this with if you go
 into product hunt and you find
 I run into this all the time
 products that are no longer
 around there's all these like
 dead startups oh yeah and in
 almost every case there just
 wasn't enough demonstrated
 demand for that thing they were
 good ideas they they kind of
 made sense logically but
 if you looked at it and go okay
 but who's doing something about
 this right now that's
 really what's most interesting
 about Derek Reimer story is
 that once he started talking
 to the people on his waiting
 list and asking okay well what
 are you doing about this
 problem
 right now yeah and often their
 response was well nothing we
 haven't done anything but
 you haven't searched on Google
 for an answer no you haven't
 searched the slack extension
 store no well that that's a bad
 sign if people aren't even
 willing to do something free
 which
 is just search for a solution
 how are you going to convince
 them to jump over all of
 these hurdles and actually take
 out their credit card out of
 their wallet and pay you
 for something and this is
 another thing I've maybe had a
 hard time to articulate is it
 takes so much momentum to get
 someone to take out their
 credit card that you've got to
 be
 sure that what you're proposing
 is something that they really
 really want and really the
 only way to to figure that out
 the only way to see that
 clearly is are they doing
 something
 about it right now and is there
 enough of these people on mass
 doing this doing something
 about it right now yeah I love
 that piece of advice I actually
 thought that it's I think
 it was actually you said that
 like you should go to Twitter
 and just search search if
 people
 are typing something like I don
't know like maybe even using
 the derrick rhymer example
 like search in Twitter for just
 switching away from slick or
 switch away from slick and
 see how many results you
 actually find and there are a
 couple I did that for fun but
 yeah and I mean that's just
 step one right because it's it
's pretty low friction to tweet
 your disappointment with
 something but at least that's
 something and then you know you
 would
 actually want to talk with
 folks and ask them questions
 like okay well what caused you
 to
 switch how long did you think
 about switching before it
 happened what what did you have
 to do internally in your team
 to make that switch happen and
 that's where you're gonna
 get a lot of answers it's one
 reasons I I worked for a
 project management software
 startup
 and what I didn't know before I
 joined is how hard it is to get
 people to switch project
 management software and it's
 remarkably difficult because
 everybody has an opinion on the
 team
 right the developers one thing
 the marketing folks want one
 another thing the CTO wants
 one thing like it goes around
 and around and so you have to
 convince not just one person
 but ten twenty people to to
 make this decision and then the
 the other kind of bad sign so
 despite how difficult it is to
 get people to switch people do
 switch all the time and
 that's also a bad sign because
 they don't just switch once and
 then they're satisfied
 they switch they try charlo and
 then they're like no this didn
't work and then they try
 base camp and then like oh that
 doesn't work and then they try
 Jira like they all end up
 in Jira right that's how it
 works yeah and so you know when
 you actually get into those
 real discussions with people
 about what is the actual
 process look like even you know
 a market like project
 management it has its own its
 own minefield right like there
's
 pros and cons and I think for
 bootstrapers it's a lot harder
 it's why we've seen you
 know base camp got in early and
 so they've done okay but really
 besides base camp everybody
 else is venture funded because
 you it just costs so much money
 and if you get on their
 list like people they Jira will
 call you they will like they've
 got sales people that want
 to onboard you right because
 they know the only way to push
 this through the whole funnel
 is to have a lot of kind of
 concerted effort doing it so a
 lot of these things a lot of
 these decisions depend on
 whether or not you're bootstra
pping whether or not you're
 bootstrapping as a solo founder
 because some of these ideas and
 markets are just harder
 to reach as a bootstrapper or
 solo founder right so with that
 like in mind and you know
 starting with the market I
 guess and maybe some ways what
 sounds like what you'd say
 is basically start with the
 market filter like that's the
 first filter that you want
 to put on of how to basically
 choose what problem you're
 going to solve how you're going
 to do it how do you like it
 seems like you know you start
 talking to customers start
 talking to users it takes a
 while before you can really
 know what's the right approach
 what's the right solution to
 actually build what do you do
 if that solution ends up being
 something that isn't something
 that a bootstrapper can do or
 it's or it's or maybe it's a
 solution
 that doesn't use your strengths
 you know as a as a founder it
 doesn't use your skills
 your abilities so how do you
 handle that when I guess
 starting with a market because
 yeah
 I mean I guess it in some ways
 it kind of goes back to there's
 just all these filters
 and in some ways all these
 things have to align which is
 obviously very hard yeah I mean
 I think that's just the this is
 another unpopular tweet of mine
 but it is just and I had to
 I had to admit this before I
 had any success but what you
 kind of have to admit in some
 way on one side is we're not
 all going to make it and a lot
 of people don't like hearing
 that but we're not all going to
 make it that there's no way
 that every single aspiring
 entrepreneur
 in the world can apply all of
 these filters and come out on
 the other side and by the
 way even if you come out on the
 other side and you know like I
 have a business now that's
 doing pretty well it could
 disappear tomorrow every day I
 wake up going well maybe today
's
 the day it disappears right
 because markets change and they
 can change really fast and
 so there's there's no like
 there's nothing really romantic
 about starting a business
 it's just there's all sorts of
 things that have to align for
 it to work and a lot of
 us aren't going to make it so
 you have to hold you have to
 hold that on one side well
 at the same time on the other
 side these things are intention
 on the other side you have to
 be super optimistic that you're
 going to make it and that you
're just going to keep trying
 because the other thing I've
 seen anecdotally I don't know
 if this is scientific but the
 people who keep trying who keep
 working at it who keep pushing
 that ball forward many
 of them do make it and so there
's a there's a little bit of how
 long can you last how
 long can you try it's why a lot
 of successful entrepreneurs
 actually tend to be
 statistically
 older because by that point in
 your life you've had a bunch of
 industry experience so you
 know what an industry is you
 know you've got connections in
 that industry you've seen
 the pain points you've seen how
 they spend money you know there
's all of this accrued
 experience that ends up being
 helpful and you know time is
 kind of what allows you to
 keep pushing right so it's not
 saying you shouldn't try in
 your 20s but because you
 could it could all align right
 my friend Nathan Barry is not
 even 30 yet and has already
 achieved
 more as a founder than a lot of
 folks but I think you have to
 have this idea of well it
 might not happen but I'm going
 to try and this might be a 10
 year project or this might
 be a 20 year project and you
 almost have to be okay with
 that like this just might take
 time for everything to align
 and the whole time I'm going to
 have to be working as if
 this will eventually work out
 and not just doing the same
 thing putting yourself in
 new circles getting outside of
 your comfort zone I've
 described this before as is it
 command
 and conquer that uses fog of
 war where you're just on a map
 and everything's dark and you
're
 exploring it yeah yeah so if
 you think about that as a
 metaphor like when you start
 out
 you're just in that map and all
 you can see is around you right
 and as you explore more
 of the map more and more parts
 become illuminated and every
 once in a while you'll end up
 in
 a spot of the map where things
 just happen right like you get
 a bunch of bounty or you
 run into a bunch of enemies or
 whatever and it's kind of like
 that like you're walking
 around for me for example I was
 walking around and I just
 happened to run into Adam Wath
en
 who I had no idea who he was or
 anything about him but he ended
 up being quite an influential
 person in the Laravel community
 and that was just me wandering
 around the map and hit him
 wandering around the map too
 and then us meeting each other
 and once once I could see like
 I've learned tons about a lot
 of my thoughts about like
 choosing a market first have
 been
 because of the influence of the
 Laravel community and looking
 at Taylor and Adam Wathen and
 Steve Shogar and Jeffrey Wei
 build these crazy businesses
 because in my little world
 before
 I met them you know this is the
 way things were done people
 like us do things like this
 and then I got over into that
 area of the map and it was like
 this whole new world opened
 up that I'd never seen before
 and without that world opening
 up I don't think I would
 have well I don't think a lot
 of things would have happened
 and so there's clearly you have
 to kind of be always doing
 things trying things getting
 out of your comfort zone
 meeting new
 people and I think the advice I
 would give my kids is just to
 explore as much of the
 map as you can as early as you
 can because the more
 exploration you do I think I
 stayed
 too local too long you know I
 grew up in this small little
 farming town in Alberta and
 then
 the big city was Edmonton and I
 just spent too much time there
 and then you know like
 the first time I flew into New
 York I was like holy shit like
 there's a lot of people
 here there's a lot of money
 here there's a lot of
 businesses here that I've never
 even
 imagined before and it kind of
 expanded my whole world view
 and unless you're doing that
 work to kind of walk around the
 map and discover new areas yeah
 I think it'll be harder to
 you know to find those markets
 to find those ideas.
 So I want to go back a little
 bit to something you said you
 know kind of talking about how
 basically this might not work
 for all of us and it's very
 hard and yeah we all might not
 make it through and that's just
 kind of the truth of it so like
 how do you and I'm just
 curious about your situation
 like how do you go to your wife
 with that and get her on board
 for this whole journey of what
 we're trying to do because so
 that's I'm just curious
 because that's definitely
 something I know me and my wife
 struggle with a lot just with
 my last thing and like it is
 hard so it's like it's you know
 you it's not just you going
 on this journey you're bringing
 your whole family with you.
 Yeah I mean again you probably
 don't want to look at the
 statistics the statistics are
 pretty bad.
 Just don't look.
 So this podcast has been titled
 unpopular opinions.
 Unpopular opinions.
 That's the joke.
 I mean it's just like if you
 want the reality the reality is
 not good statistically.
 I mean clearly I think I think
 all entrepreneurs have this
 feeling that maybe they can do
 it
 better than the next guy and
 because statistically you know
 millions of people start
 businesses
 but those people are in all
 sorts of different places have
 all sorts of different leverage
 have all sorts of different
 privilege you know there's
 there's all these factors that
 go into you know why a person
 becomes a successor not and I
 think every entrepreneur feels
 like
 they've got some secret sauce
 that'll make them better than
 the next guy.
 Oh yeah.
 But I mean in my early 20s I
 started a couple retail shops
 that ended up losing a lot of
 money and that was hard to
 recover from as a family.
 And so that that is just part
 of it like if you're going to
 be on that.
 So that was almost 20 years ago
.
 And yeah so now I'm at a place
 where you know maybe I've
 learned enough lessons that I
've
 made enough connections that
 things are happening.
 But that's a long journey.
 That's 10 20 years of of work.
 And so yeah I mean I think that
's something you got to consider
 with kind of with everything.
 I don't think you should kill
 yourself in the process.
 I think I think I worked
 probably too hard a lot of
 those years when I didn't need
 to
 it's just wasted cycles trying
 to make something happen you
 know you're you're it's far
 better
 for you to book a ticket to a
 conference that you've never
 been to then to work 60 70
 80 hours a week.
 Because at least for me that
 the biggest jumps forward have
 been because I met somebody
 outside of my circle.
 I met John Buddha my co-founder
 in 2014 at this kind of
 experimental technology art
 design
 festival called XOXO.
 And you know I wasn't going to
 go initially.
 I had to kind of push myself to
 get out of the house and
 actually go.
 So yeah I don't think there's
 any easy answers there.
 I think you can't stare step
 your way up.
 You can do something small on
 the side and then see if that
 evolves into something bigger
 and then something bigger and
 then something bigger.
 Nathan Barry just wrote a piece
 on this that I don't fully like
 or agree with.
 But maybe I don't like it just
 because it's the hard truth.
 He talks about a series of lad
ders and you know the first
 ladder is just like trading
 time for money and then you
 kind of work up that ladder
 right.
 You can work yourself up from
 making minimum wage up to
 making more money per hour.
 But then you go to the next
 ladder which has higher earning
 potential but it's harder.
 It's just like OK now you've
 got to you're trading time for
 money but it's more on your
 terms like consulting and so
 then you work your way up that
 level.
 And then there's another ladder
 and you know these keep going
 and the difficulty with each
 ladder goes up and but your
 potential in his case he's just
 talking about income earning
 potential your income earning
 potential goes up as well.
 And it is a little bit of a
 stair step right like you're
 moving your way up here and
 then
 you're like oh well there's
 opportunity over here so then
 you might take a few steps back
 to start here and then build
 yourself up here.
 And then you look at the next
 ladder you go there's more
 opportunity over there so then
 you go back down and then work
 your way up.
 Yeah that's all possible.
 Money helps if you have in
 terms of like having a decent
 life it helps if you have a lot
 more
 cash saved up the more cash you
 have saved up the less stress
 you have but that's not
 always possible either right.
 So that the only way I can
 think of to alleviate the
 stress is to have very low cost
 of living
 and or a lot of money saved up.
 Money that you can risk that
 you wouldn't feel bad about
 losing.
 So and you can even hear this
 in John and I's podcast you
 know he was working for Cards
 Against Humanity when we
 started this and he also had
 more money saved up than I did
 and so my stress level when we
 weren't quite yet full time yet
 was a lot higher.
 I'm just like oh god like do we
 got to take investment we got
 to try to add three or four
 more things on top of this to
 make this work.
 You can see how like
 desperation affects your
 actions and a lot of businesses
 you'll see
 do this like one thing's not
 working quite enough so then
 they add another thing to
 hopefully
 bring up in more income and
 that's not quite bringing
 enough so they add another
 thing and
 they just keep adding more and
 more stuff and more and more
 stress to their lives.
 But yeah for John it's easy he
's got no dependence and his
 cost of living is low and he
 had a
 bunch of money saved up.
 For him this isn't making or
 break it it's like no I can
 just if this doesn't work I'm
 fine so that if you want to
 make it easier I think lower
 your expenses and save a bunch
 of money or get someone to give
 you a bunch of money or rob a
 bank or whatever.
 Yeah go the easier route.
 I mean this is why privilege
 plays such a big part in
 business like some people do
 they
 get a they have a big trust
 fund and they get a bunch of
 money it does help.
 Yeah I agree.
 Yeah that makes sense.
 So maybe as a last question we
 could end with maybe you've
 heard how I built this podcast
 they always end with an
 interesting question which is
 so for you I'm just interested
 in
 hearing as well like with
 transistor like where you guys
 gotten so far how much do you
 think of that was luck and how
 much of it was you know you and
 John's skill and talents
 and hard work.
 It's definitely the
 accumulation of a lifetime of
 experience and I think I think
 your attitude
 matters a lot in that right
 like are you going to keep
 going out and trying things are
 you
 going to keep going out and
 trying to push the envelope are
 you going to keep going out
 and put things out in public
 are you going to go out and
 meet people like if you were
 going to split test my life and
 you put one Justin in his room
 and he never leaves and
 all he does is play Sonic the H
edgehog forever and then you
 have another version where he's
 like always going out and
 trying to figure things out and
 trying to build things and
 trying to write and trying to
 meet this person and for sure
 in that A/B test you know
 Justin
 B wins there's I don't think it
's that's a it's not too
 difficult to see that so yeah
 there's a lot of luck and where
 I was born and but you're the
 the the influence of luck
 starts to go down a lot like
 the the the influence of blind
 luck like just like where you
 were
 born like what what year and
 country and location and
 parents you were born to after
 that part
 you make your most of your luck
 just by whatever attitude you
 have every day there's still
 some privilege that comes with
 where you were born but most of
 that kind of built in luck
 is already happened by the time
 you were born yeah cool well
 thanks Justin for coming on
 that was a good conversation
 very helpful for both of us I'm
 sure for our listeners as well
 I didn't bum you out too much
 no I mean sometimes you need a
 little of that get you back
 back
 to the truth so yeah thanks
 Justin and we'll see you guys
 in another episode and we'll
 put everything in the show
 notes alright bye see ya
