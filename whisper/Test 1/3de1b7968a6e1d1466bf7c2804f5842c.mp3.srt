 This is Transistor.fm.

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,760
 Hey, product people.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,620
 Justin Jackson here, and I've

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,530
 got a brand new interview for

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,440
 you with James Clear, who

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,520
 is the author of Atomic Habits,

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,450
 a book that has really changed

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,400
 my life since I've read

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
 it.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,030
 And I don't want to give too

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,280
 much of an intro.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,260
 I just want to get right into

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,800
 the actual interview.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,210
 If you like this, please reach

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,850
 out to James on Twitter @JamesC

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,320
lear.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,610
 And if you have comments about

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,930
 the episode, reach out to me on

19
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,560
 Twitter.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,010
 I'm the letter M, the letter I,

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,160
 Justin, M, I, Justin.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,680
 Here is me and James talking

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,180
 about habits and how you can

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,440
 make your life better one

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:09,080
 day at a time.

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,180
 The book, your book's been out

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,760
 for a while.

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,800
 It's right here, Atomic Habits.

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,360
 If you see it in an airport or

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,610
 something near you, how long

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,560
 has it been out now?

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,840
 Today is 100 days exactly.

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
 No way.

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,540
 Yeah, so just over three months

35
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:25,640
.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,130
 I'm curious, because now it's

37
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,560
 been out for a while.

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,860
 Is there one idea that you see

39
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,530
 that people keep sharing, like

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,440
 one idea that resonated

41
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,300
 from the book in particular

42
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,120
 that gets shared more than

43
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,180
 anything else on Twitter or

44
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,920
 whatever?

45
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,400
 So I was curious about that

46
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,020
 myself when I was writing the

47
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,840
 book and thinking about it,

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,690
 because I kind of felt like,

49
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,500
 all right, hopefully all these

50
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,800
 ideas are useful.

51
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,730
 What's the one thing that

52
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,770
 people are going to latch on to

53
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:56,960
?

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,520
 Because sometimes you'll hear

55
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,740
 that from authors that there

56
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,160
 was one chapter or something

57
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,440
 that

58
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,740
 was the chapter that really

59
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,600
 stuck with people.

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,920
 I'm grateful for the fact that

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,350
 there are a variety of things,

62
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,680
 but there are a few things.

63
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,750
 So the first one is identity-

64
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,310
based habits, which is chapter

65
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,680
 two.

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,510
 And that concept really seems

67
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,520
 to have resonated with people,

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,460
 the idea of trying to reinforce

69
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,750
 your desired identity and

70
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,190
 starting with who you want to

71
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,550
 become rather than what you

72
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,840
 want

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,560
 to achieve.

74
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,200
 And I'm glad that it did,

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,170
 because that was the chapter I

76
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,240
 debated over the most of where

77
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,640
 to put it in the book.

78
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,920
 At different points, it was the

79
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,720
 first chapter.

80
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,200
 It was the last chapter.

81
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,280
 It ended up being the second

82
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,600
 one.

83
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,110
 I also had this thought in my

84
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,620
 head that it should be about

85
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,240
 midway through the book.

86
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,700
 So it really jumped all over

87
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,050
 the place, but I ended up

88
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,720
 thinking, I feel like this is

89
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:51,880
 one

90
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,180
 of the best ideas, so I want to

91
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,490
 have it early so that people,

92
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,760
 even if they don't finish

93
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,300
 the book, they still come

94
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,520
 across this idea.

95
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,130
 And I'm glad that that ended up

96
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,960
 working out well.

97
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,950
 The other one that people bring

98
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,740
 up a lot is the two-minute rule

99
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,280
 and the idea of scaling

100
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,820
 your habits down to the point

101
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,430
 where they take two minutes or

102
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,920
 less.

103
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,400
 I think that that's a very

104
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
 actionable one.

105
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,820
 It's like, OK, I know exactly

106
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,360
 what to do.

107
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,800
 I wanted to do a workout, but

108
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,180
 now I'll just focus on doing

109
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,160
 five push-ups.

110
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,880
 Or I wanted to read 30 books

111
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,540
 this year, and now I'll focus

112
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,080
 on reading one page a day or

113
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
 something like that.

114
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 Got you.

115
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,830
 So I think the actionableness

116
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,740
 of that one also tends to stick

117
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:30,840
.

118
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,130
 And so going back to the

119
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,260
 identity one, is this the idea

120
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,280
 that every action you take or

121
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,900
 every habit you develop is a

122
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,640
 vote for the person you want to

123
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,320
 become?

124
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
 Right.

125
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,200
 So that's kind of like my core

126
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,890
 philosophy behind it, this idea

127
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,680
 that the way that we develop

128
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,730
 beliefs about ourselves, that

129
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,700
 we reinforce our self-image,

130
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,600
 that we develop our identity

131
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,660
 to a certain degree, is largely

132
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,680
 reinforced by the experiences

133
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,600
 and behaviors that we perform

134
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 over time.

135
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,690
 So some aspects of your

136
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,290
 identity are relatively fixed,

137
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,780
 like, for example, if you're

138
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,680
 tall or

139
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
 short.

140
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,520
 Even that idea that I am tall

141
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
 or I am short, that's

142
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,040
 reinforced.

143
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,650
 You learn that through

144
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,400
 experiences in life.

145
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,140
 Now there are many aspects of

146
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,810
 your identity that are less

147
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,760
 fixed than that, but are still

148
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,000
 reinforced by your experiences.

149
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,550
 So if you write one sentence

150
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,660
 today, you probably don't think

151
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,450
 about yourself as I am a writer

152
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:35,880
.

153
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,350
 But if you do that every day

154
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,950
 for six months or nine months

155
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,600
 or a year, at some point you

156
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,950
 turn around and you think, "Huh

157
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,200
, maybe I am the kind of person

158
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,040
 who is a writer."

159
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,280
 Or if you study biology every

160
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,080
 Tuesday night for 20 minutes,

161
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,320
 you at some point think, "I

162
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
 guess I'm studious.

163
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
 I keep doing this every week.

164
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,040
 Maybe this is the kind of

165
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,760
 person I am."

166
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,570
 And so I like that idea that

167
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,560
 our habits are like votes for

168
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,640
 the type of person we believe

169
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,630
 that we are, that they build up

170
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,090
 evidence of looking at

171
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,080
 ourselves in a certain way.

172
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,840
 And I like to phrase it that

173
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
 way not only because I believe

174
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
 that it's true, but also

175
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,440
 beliefs and behavior are kind

176
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,920
 of a two-way street.

177
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,650
 So you'll hear people say

178
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,870
 things like, "Just be positive

179
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,040
 or just believe in yourself or

180
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
 fake it till you make it," or

181
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
 things like that.

182
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,060
 And there's nothing necessarily

183
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,660
 wrong with fake it till you

184
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,400
 make it.

185
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,790
 It's fine to be positive and

186
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,500
 believe things about yourself,

187
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,920
 but it's a very short-term

188
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,840
 strategy because fake it till

189
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,290
 you make it is asking you to

190
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,880
 believe something about

191
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,520
 yourself

192
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,480
 without having evidence for it.

193
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,860
 It's like that kind of

194
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,920
 visualization stuff or mantra

195
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,970
 stuff where you look at

196
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,480
 yourself

197
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,250
 in the mirror and you tell

198
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,200
 yourself, "I am a writer.

199
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,120
 I am a writer," even though you

200
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,700
 haven't written yet.

201
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,040
 And so what I'm saying is

202
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,290
 similar, but I think

203
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,020
 importantly different in the

204
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,360
 sense that you

205
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,040
 let the behavior lead the way

206
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,640
 rather than the belief.

207
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,110
 And I think that's the best

208
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,850
 lever we have for changing the

209
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,680
 way that we look at ourselves,

210
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,060
 which is to say, show up and

211
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,670
 write a sentence every day, and

212
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,000
 soon you're going to have

213
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,320
 something

214
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,440
 to root that new identity of, "

215
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,800
I am a writer in."

216
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,140
 And it's a much more, I think,

217
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,340
 robust and long-term way of

218
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,480
 changing how you look at

219
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 yourself.

220
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,000
 Yeah, I think for me the...

221
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,110
 Because you first communicated

222
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,550
 that idea to me in an airport

223
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,840
 in Denver.

224
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,160
 Yeah, I remember that.

225
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,560
 And at the time in my life, I

226
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,720
 was not doing so good.

227
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,920
 I was depressed.

228
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
 I was, I think, cynical.

229
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,710
 Especially, I think cynical

230
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,980
 about people like you that seem

231
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,520
 to have it all together, that

232
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,160
 seem to be really like doing

233
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
 all the good habits.

234
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,250
 And when you're not doing so

235
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,740
 good, looking at someone that

236
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,360
 seems to have it all together

237
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,630
 just can make you more grumpy

238
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,370
 or more cynical or more

239
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,520
 whatever.

240
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,860
 But I remember you sitting down

241
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,930
 and kind of hashing this out

242
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,800
 with me.

243
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,450
 And that idea of, "Justin, no

244
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,910
 matter where you're at right

245
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,480
 now and no matter what you've

246
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,740
 done, you could start today

247
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,080
 with one action."

248
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,520
 So if you go running today,

249
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,830
 that might not make a big

250
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,120
 difference.

251
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,870
 And then if you do it tomorrow

252
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,220
 and then the next day and then

253
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,640
 the next day and then the

254
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,870
 next day, at the end of the

255
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,440
 week, you might say, "Well,

256
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,880
 wait a second.

257
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,120
 I think I'm a runner."

258
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,050
 And maybe after a couple of

259
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,210
 weeks, you might say, "Well, I

260
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,240
'm going to get myself some

261
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,520
 runner

262
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,770
 clothes and go and get some

263
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,720
 runner clothes.

264
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,520
 And then I'm going to get

265
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,640
 myself a good pair of...

266
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,750
 Shoot, I'm going to install

267
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,320
 that Strava app."

268
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,330
 And all of a sudden you could

269
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,000
 see yourself.

270
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,950
 That was a really hopeful

271
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,900
 message for me when I was

272
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,310
 really struggling to figure out

273
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:57,680
.

274
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
 It was way easier for me to be

275
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
 cynical and just kind of look

276
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,880
 back at all these people

277
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,410
 implementing good, healthy

278
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,110
 processes and say, "Well, that

279
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,000
's not for me.

280
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,650
 That's just for people that

281
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,560
 whatever."

282
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,230
 But seeing, hearing that gave

283
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,660
 me hope to think, "I could do

284
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,480
 that.

285
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,030
 And it's surprising how little

286
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,030
 time it takes to accomplish

287
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,200
 that.

288
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,120
 Is that something...

289
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,110
 Have other people been kind of

290
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,440
 referencing that too?

291
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,200
 Is that part of the...

292
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,420
 And maybe that's what's so good

293
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,610
 about having it as chapter two

294
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,680
 because it gives me some

295
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
 hope, right?

296
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
 Right, yeah.

297
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,980
 Well, what's interesting is

298
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,290
 that that process of changing

299
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,640
 in that way, it's happening

300
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,200
 anyway.

301
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,530
 If you think back to the

302
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,350
 beginning, for example, if I

303
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,960
 think of the early days of my

304
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,080
 entrepreneurial

305
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,820
 career, well, I didn't have any

306
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,520
 entrepreneurs in my family.

307
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,840
 I didn't have any close friends

308
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
 who were entrepreneurs.

309
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,560
 There was no reason for me to

310
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,820
 think that's who I am or to

311
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,340
 feel like I was externally

312
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,640
 validated with that was part of

313
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,320
 my identity.

314
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,400
 I had no evidence of it.

315
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,140
 And so early on, all I had was

316
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,240
 hope, right?

317
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,430
 The hope that, "Oh, maybe I'll

318
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,600
 be able to build something.

319
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,210
 Maybe I'll be able to make this

320
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,760
 work."

321
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,260
 But then you start to show up,

322
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,640
 and for me, it was probably

323
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
 about two years in.

324
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,300
 It's probably about where I

325
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,090
 kind of like the scale tipped,

326
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,840
 and I started to think, "I am

327
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 an entrepreneur.

328
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,600
 That's part of who I am."

329
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,930
 But it really took proving it

330
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,680
 to myself that I can pay my

331
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,120
 bills through this, that I can

332
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,890
 like actually have a lifestyle

333
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,440
 and a career in this way.

334
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,930
 I had to prove it for about two

335
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,500
 years before I really started

336
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,880
 to latch onto it and say,

337
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,560
 "This is who I am."

338
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,370
 And so my point is, that's

339
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,120
 always happening.

340
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,900
 You're continually updating

341
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,610
 your beliefs about yourself

342
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,480
 based on the experiences that

343
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,600
 you're

344
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 going through.

345
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,250
 And all I'm talking about is

346
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,120
 simply designing that process

347
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,800
 in a little more careful or

348
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,320
 thoughtful

349
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,700
 way rather than just kind of

350
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,200
 letting it happen to you and be

351
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,490
 like, "Well, I guess I'll

352
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:58,720
 figure

353
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,460
 out who I am based on what life

354
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,280
 throws at me versus how about I

355
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,760
 figure out who I am based

356
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,420
 on the votes that I cast each

357
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,240
 day and what habits I decide to

358
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,040
 follow?"

359
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 Yeah, yeah.

360
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,830
 Again, that is a very hopeful

361
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,780
 message for someone who's just

362
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,200
 kind of sitting back and

363
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,960
 waiting for it to happen.

364
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,820
 What sustains you when you're

365
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,360
 in the process but not there

366
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
 yet?

367
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,190
 Like you mentioned entrepreneur

368
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,820
 and you're like, "Man, it took

369
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,760
 a long time."

370
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
 What sustains you?

371
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,230
 Good question because I think a

372
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,880
 lot of habits, entrepreneurship

373
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,560
 is certainly this way, exercise

374
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,230
 is this way where the rewards

375
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,330
 of a habit are often very

376
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,880
 delayed.

377
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,670
 What's the reward for working

378
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,880
 out for three weeks?

379
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,820
 Not really a whole lot,

380
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,400
 honestly.

381
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,820
 Your body hasn't really changed

382
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,000
.

383
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,320
 The scale is probably about the

384
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,880
 same.

385
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,960
 You're probably just sore.

386
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,530
 There probably isn't a whole

387
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,680
 lot to show for it.

388
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,950
 It's really not unless you

389
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,390
 stick with that habit for three

390
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,600
 months or six months or a

391
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,620
 year that you actually start to

392
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,640
 see the changes you were hoping

393
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,400
 to get when you set out.

394
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,630
 There's this valley of death in

395
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,780
 the beginning where in a way it

396
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,760
 gets harder before it gets

397
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 easier.

398
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,960
 It feels uncomfortable.

399
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,880
 You feel sore and pain.

400
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,250
 You feel uncertain when you

401
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,160
 walk in the gym.

402
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,440
 You feel like people are

403
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,080
 judging you.

404
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,190
 Same way with starting a

405
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,840
 business.

406
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,040
 In a weird way, it's harder

407
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
 before it gets easier.

408
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,570
 You start out, but you're not

409
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,520
 making any money.

410
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,850
 You feel stupid a lot of the

411
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,420
 time because you don't know how

412
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,600
 to make a sales call or

413
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,360
 what customers are looking for

414
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,180
 or whether you're even offering

415
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,480
 the right product.

416
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,240
 I remember when I first started

417
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,830
, like I said, I didn't know

418
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,640
 anybody.

419
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,840
 Didn't have any entrepreneurs

420
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,480
 in my family.

421
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,550
 I was like, "Well, I need to

422
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,680
 get to know some people."

423
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,910
 I sent a bunch of emails to

424
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,130
 reach out and just ask if

425
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,640
 people would chat on Skype for

426
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,720
 like 30 minutes or whatever.

427
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,220
 I remember sending those first

428
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,650
 few and thinking, "Do people

429
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,480
 even do this?

430
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,600
 Do people chat on Skype with

431
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,710
 people that they haven't met

432
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,200
 before?

433
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,000
 Is this a weird thing to ask?"

434
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,890
 There's just a lot of that

435
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,800
 uncertainty early on.

436
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,020
 Your point is, I think, a valid

437
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,240
 one, which is, "Well, what do

438
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
 you do to get through that?

439
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,570
 How do you get through that

440
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,880
 valley of death while you're

441
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,140
 waiting for the long-term

442
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,680
 rewards

443
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
 to accumulate?"

444
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,650
 I think that this is where

445
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,430
 psychologists call it

446
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,790
 reinforcement or an external

447
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,040
 reinforcer,

448
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,510
 that you want some kind of

449
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,490
 reinforcement that is enjoyable

450
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,240
 in the moment so that you have

451
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,720
 a reason to keep showing up.

452
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,220
 There are from a habit

453
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,470
 standpoint, there are two ways

454
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,440
 to do this.

455
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,420
 First thing is just a strategic

456
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,410
 choice about what type of habit

457
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,040
 you choose to follow.

458
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,470
 If we go back to the exercise

459
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,180
 example, well, not everybody

460
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,640
 has to work out like a body

461
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
 builder.

462
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,190
 You could do Pilates or yoga or

463
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,540
 go for a run or rock climbing

464
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,280
 or all kinds of stuff.

465
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,000
 Pick the form of a habit that

466
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,860
 brings you the most joy, that

467
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,680
 is most enjoyable to you.

468
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,970
 It's going to be a slog for,

469
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,280
 you're going to have to swim

470
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,600
 for months to see a change

471
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 in your body.

472
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,230
 You're going to have to cycle

473
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,600
 for months.

474
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,450
 You're going to have to lift

475
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,200
 weights for months.

476
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,210
 It doesn't really matter which

477
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:06,840
 one you choose.

478
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,560
 It's going to take a while.

479
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,270
 You might as well choose the

480
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,990
 one that's most exciting or

481
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,320
 enjoyable to you.

482
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,990
 Same way with like, imagine a

483
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,080
 reading habit.

484
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
 You don't have to read.

485
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,220
 You might feel like, "Oh, I

486
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,340
 have a business, so I need to

487
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,520
 read business books."

488
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,780
 But really ultimately, the most

489
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,920
 important thing is do you get

490
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,960
 in the habit of reading?

491
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,610
 Do you fall in love with

492
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,520
 reading?

493
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,070
 If you need to start with sci-

494
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,840
fi books or fantasy or something

495
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,280
 like that, well, start

496
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
 with that.

497
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,990
 Do the one that is intrins

498
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,440
ically valuable to you at first.

499
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,230
 Once the habit is built, then

500
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,940
 you can transition to some of

501
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,160
 the other stuff.

502
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,660
 That's one method for getting

503
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,320
 through that valley of death.

504
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
 Yeah.

505
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,870
 I think this brings up maybe a

506
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,450
 harder question, which is, so

507
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,310
 based on your book, it's

508
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,160
 January

509
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,780
 and I'm thinking, "Okay, I

510
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,260
 haven't been in the gym for

511
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,280
 seven years.

512
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,560
 I used to love working out.

513
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,240
 I'm going to go.

514
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
 I got my streaks app on my

515
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,000
 phone.

516
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,160
 Start going."

517
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,210
 I've probably been, I don't

518
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,260
 know, I've probably been at

519
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,800
 least 18 days or maybe even 20

520
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,000
 days

521
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 this month.

522
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,120
 It's great.

523
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,620
 I was surprised by how fast I

524
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,320
 felt.

525
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,390
 The first day, I felt like I

526
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,160
 didn't belong.

527
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
 I felt awkward.

528
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,130
 I don't know anybody here I'm

529
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,160
 walking in.

530
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,570
 Some of the machinery, I

531
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,440
 recognize.

532
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
 Some I don't.

533
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,720
 I have to get back into a

534
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,960
 routine.

535
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
 I have to find which exercise I

536
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,120
'm going to do.

537
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,010
 There's all these insecurities

538
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,680
 and questions.

539
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,990
 But after a week, I felt like I

540
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,520
 belonged.

541
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,630
 But I wonder if that's because

542
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,040
 it was easier for me.

543
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,380
 I had this, I'm relatively, I

544
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,160
 was already relatively in shape

545
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,320
.

546
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
 There's a big difference

547
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,010
 between going in where you feel

548
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,400
 like, "Oh, maybe I'm a few

549
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
 pounds overweight."

550
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,290
 Going in and being 200 pounds

551
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,160
 overweight.

552
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,410
 There's a big difference

553
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,730
 between going in even as a

554
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,760
 white male compared to, there's

555
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,100
 a big difference going in and

556
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,630
 feeling like, "Well, I've done

557
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,040
 these exercises before so

558
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,850
 I'm not completely out of my

559
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,880
 element."

560
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,770
 And I'm wondering how, I mean,

561
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,160
 are habits like that achievable

562
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,520
 because of privilege

563
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,160
 and context and other things.

564
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,340
 How much does that play into it

565
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,640
?

566
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,990
 And if someone is walking in

567
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,570
 and they're 200 pounds

568
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,440
 overweight, do they still have

569
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,520
 the

570
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,700
 same chance of progress and

571
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,680
 success?

572
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,520
 It just feels like such a big

573
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,560
 mountain for them to go over.

574
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,720
 For sure.

575
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 Yeah.

576
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,330
 So, this is one reason why I

577
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,870
 think starting with small

578
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,270
 habits is so incredibly

579
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:58,960
 important

580
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,410
 because a lot of the time when

581
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,000
 we think about the outcome that

582
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,640
 you want, so just to continue

583
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,080
 your weight loss or exercise

584
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,820
 example, everybody gets wrapped

585
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,240
 up and like, "Oh, I want to

586
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,440
 lose

587
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,590
 100 pounds or I want to lose 20

588
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,160
 pounds or whatever the number

589
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,640
 is."

590
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,160
 But you forget about there,

591
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,490
 like all these little log

592
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,130
istical and emotional details

593
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:17,440
 that

594
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,620
 come along with starting a new

595
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,360
 habit.

596
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,620
 So I'll often tell the story

597
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,100
 about, I have this reader who,

598
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,720
 he ended up losing over 100

599
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
 pounds.

600
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,850
 And one of the first things he

601
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,010
 did was he went to the gym, but

602
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,000
 he wasn't allowed to

603
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,260
 stay for longer than five

604
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,880
 minutes.

605
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,610
 So he drove to the gym, got out

606
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,780
 of the car, did half an

607
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,720
 exercise, got back in the car,

608
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,880
 drove home.

609
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,190
 And it sounds ridiculous to

610
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,760
 people.

611
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,020
 It sounds silly because it's

612
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,600
 like, "Well, clearly exercising

613
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
 for five minutes is not

614
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
 going to get you in shape."

615
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
 I guess not.

616
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
 But what you realize is he was

617
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,620
 mastering the art of showing up

618
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:48,840
.

619
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,380
 He was becoming the type of

620
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,990
 person that drove to the gym

621
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,800
 every day.

622
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,500
 And when you're in that state,

623
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,130
 for him at that point, that was

624
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,520
 the biggest shift was,

625
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,150
 "Can I just become the type of

626
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,770
 person who gets in here, who

627
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,480
 overcomes the uncertainty

628
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,290
 or feeling uncomfortable or

629
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,600
 feeling judged?"

630
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,620
 And all those things are very

631
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,490
 real hurdles to building a

632
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,240
 habit.

633
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,090
 There are all these little

634
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:11,920
 questions that need to be

635
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,860
 answered for something like

636
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,360
 that.

637
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,940
 Like, "Okay, I want to go to

638
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,640
 the gym.

639
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,960
 Well, what time am I going to

640
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,280
 go?

641
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,770
 Am I going to go before work or

642
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,600
 after work?

643
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,120
 What gym will I go to?

644
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,420
 What route am I going to take

645
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,160
 to get there?

646
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,560
 Do I need to bring a water

647
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,310
 bottle or is there like a water

648
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,760
 fountain at the gym?"

649
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,590
 And all those little questions

650
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,410
 like that, like whether or not

651
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,960
 there's a water fountain

652
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,840
 at the gym, it sounds small.

653
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,860
 But if you already feel

654
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,310
 uncomfortable and feel like you

655
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,520
 don't belong and then you

656
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:38,800
 always

657
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,560
 forget to bring your water

658
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,450
 bottle and you're like, "Oh,

659
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,430
 there's nothing ever, and there

660
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,560
's

661
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,880
 never anything to drink there."

662
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,290
 That's enough friction to get

663
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,760
 you to quit in the beginning.

664
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,020
 So starting with something

665
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,550
 simple, like, "All I'm going to

666
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,120
 do is I'm going to show up and

667
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,790
 I'm going to do one exercise

668
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,540
 for five minutes and then I'm

669
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,600
 going to go."

670
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,950
 That I think is a good way to

671
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,480
 start.

672
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,880
 And it reminds me of what

673
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,600
 Steven Pressfield wrote.

674
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,570
 I think it was in the War of

675
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,760
 Art where he said something to

676
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,840
 the effect of like, "If

677
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,310
 you sit down each day at the

678
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,650
 computer and you do your

679
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,260
 writing, at some point, at

680
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,720
 first

681
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,240
 it feels uncomfortable, but at

682
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,610
 some point that becomes your

683
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,400
 territory."

684
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,730
 And I really like that phrasing

685
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,890
 of it because for an animal,

686
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,920
 for a wolf or something, a

687
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,610
 piece of land does not become

688
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,310
 their territory unless they

689
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,000
 spend time in it, right?

690
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,920
 Unless they are there each day.

691
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,340
 It has to become comfortable

692
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,840
 first.

693
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,420
 And so for many people building

694
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,130
 habits, whether that's getting

695
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,440
 into the gym or going to the

696
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,940
 yoga studio or sitting your

697
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,630
 butt in the chair and writing,

698
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,060
 you need to make that space

699
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,400
 your

700
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
 territory.

701
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,350
 And the very first step is not

702
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,800
 getting a result.

703
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,440
 It's spending time there.

704
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,120
 It's making that little bit of

705
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,800
 land a zone where you feel like

706
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,360
, "This is where I belong

707
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
 each day."

708
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,180
 And that's a big emotional

709
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,340
 hurdle to cross before you even

710
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,600
 worry about any of the physical

711
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,480
 or actual technical things to

712
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,880
 do.

713
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
 Yeah.

714
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,070
 And I mean, the other thing

715
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,480
 that helped is I went with my

716
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,360
 wife and it's funny because

717
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,650
 I felt like I'm like Mr. Conf

718
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,140
ident, but she was like, at one

719
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,600
 point, she's like, "Justin,

720
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
 you are so nervous right now."

721
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,000
 She could tell how nervous I

722
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,600
 was.

723
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,560
 But I thought I was keeping it

724
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,760
 all together.

725
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,850
 And it just reminded me of, I'd

726
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,700
 been to gyms from the time I

727
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,240
 was in grade nine all the

728
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,680
 way through college.

729
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,070
 It wasn't like it was

730
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,690
 unfamiliar, but I was nervous

731
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,400
 because it was unfamiliar.

732
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
 There had been a seven-year gap

733
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,320
 and now I was exploring this

734
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
 again, worried about what

735
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,900
 these people are thinking about

736
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,240
 me.

737
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,200
 "Wow, that guy looks like he's

738
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,800
 way more fit than me."

739
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,430
 All these thoughts go through

740
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,360
 your head.

741
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,110
 And so, yeah, I think kind of

742
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,870
 figuring out how you can make a

743
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,240
 step and sometimes maybe

744
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,110
 it's like going with somebody

745
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,910
 so you at least have some

746
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,270
 emotional, because it's

747
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,240
 emotional.

748
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,860
 It's nice to have someone to

749
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,490
 kind of share the emotional

750
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,720
 burden, right?

751
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
 For sure.

752
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,520
 Well, if you come, the thing

753
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,270
 that ultimately what you're

754
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,160
 looking to do is, like we just

755
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,460
 said, feel like it's part of

756
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,360
 your territory.

757
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,570
 And because there are other

758
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,980
 people in that space, what that

759
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,320
 also means is you're looking

760
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,930
 to feel like you're part of the

761
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,720
 tribe who goes there, right?

762
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,350
 You belong with the other

763
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,360
 people who are in that room.

764
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,700
 And so it helps to, what is a

765
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,600
 tribe?

766
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,720
 Well, it's a group of people

767
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,900
 that you get along with, that

768
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,440
 you bond with, that you belong

769
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,450
 to over something else, over

770
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,200
 some shared interest.

771
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,420
 And in other words, it's a

772
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,480
 group in a lot of ways of

773
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,200
 friends, friends who share some

774
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
 kind of interest.

775
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,840
 So these are your gym friends.

776
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,600
 Well, if you go with your wife,

777
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,320
 then you automatically have at

778
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,060
 least one person in the tribe

779
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,360
 that

780
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,320
 you are friends with, that you

781
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,520
 do belong with.

782
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,130
 And so I think that helps you

783
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,020
 get over that hurdle a little

784
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,320
 bit.

785
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,940
 You're no longer facing that

786
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,160
 challenge alone.

787
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,980
 Before it was like, I am trying

788
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,760
 to get fit.

789
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,930
 Now it is we are trying to get

790
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,480
 fit.

791
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
 And that helps a lot with the

792
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,240
 kind of the mental feeling of

793
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,160
 like, do I belong or not?

794
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
 Yeah.

795
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,600
 So I don't mean to stay on this

796
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,950
 too long, but it's so fresh

797
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,240
 that the other thing I found

798
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,030
 myself doing, because I'm

799
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,910
 interested in the emotional

800
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,800
 friction behind habits.

801
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,840
 And so the other thing I was

802
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,120
 doing is I was going in there

803
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
 and I'm uncomfortable.

804
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,880
 So I'm trying to act really

805
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,520
 tough, but I'm not tough at all

806
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,880
.

807
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,560
 But when people look at me, I'm

808
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,310
 kind of like scowling when like

809
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,800
 I'm not being friendly.

810
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,160
 I'm not being myself.

811
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,990
 And I was thinking about that

812
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,730
 and thinking like when you're

813
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,240
 kind of inward focused and

814
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
 you're in a new environment and

815
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,130
 you're trying to develop a new

816
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,080
 habit, but you're inward

817
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,240
 focused,

818
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,210
 it really is, it doesn't really

819
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,000
 help.

820
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,840
 And so I had to kind of turn

821
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,920
 that around and go, okay, I got

822
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,880
 to start being friendly.

823
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,370
 I got to start saying hi to

824
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,310
 these people, because if I wave

825
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,000
 at this person and it feels

826
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,820
 good, like they respond with a

827
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,840
 smile.

828
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,940
 And that happens again next

829
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,320
 time.

830
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,620
 And again, next time, that's a

831
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,920
 little bit of a reward for me.

832
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,050
 That's going to keep me going

833
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,560
 to the gym.

834
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,850
 But if I keep going here with

835
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,530
 this like tough scowl on my

836
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,760
 face, and it's hard because you

837
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,840
 feel like you don't belong.

838
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,280
 You feel nervous.

839
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,320
 And you kind of default to

840
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,560
 these weird behaviors.

841
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,710
 And it took a little bit of

842
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,670
 time, but I realized, okay, now

843
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,040
 I got to get in the habit of

844
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,640
 smiling

845
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,180
 and saying hello when I'm in

846
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,920
 the gym, not just being like in

847
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,520
 my own zone and pretending

848
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,760
 I'm somebody I'm not, right?

849
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,090
 Well, that's one thing that

850
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,260
 kind of helps you start to

851
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,640
 belong or become part of the

852
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,280
 rest of the tribe.

853
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,510
 Just a friendly behavior helps

854
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,310
 you start to develop

855
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,550
 friendships with some of those

856
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:55,860
 other

857
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
 people that are there.

858
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
 Yeah.

859
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,300
 A study that I wanted to cite

860
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,040
 in Atomic Habits, but I couldn

861
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,560
't find it to track it down.

862
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,090
 But I read about it years ago,

863
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,720
 where the YMCA ran a survey.

864
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,490
 And when they surveyed people

865
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,250
 who were joining the gym, the

866
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,800
 thing that got them to join

867
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,200
 were

868
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,790
 the different classes offered,

869
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,140
 the equipment that was in the

870
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,560
 gym, basically facilities

871
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,110
 and features were the things

872
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,460
 that got people in for the

873
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,320
 first time.

874
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,410
 But then when they surveyed

875
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,590
 members who had been there for

876
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,840
 over a year, the thing that

877
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,390
 got people to stick, nobody

878
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,620
 mentioned features or

879
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,500
 facilities.

880
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,300
 Everybody mentioned friendships

881
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,500
.

882
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,840
 And so the people who actually

883
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,200
 stayed at the gym or kept their

884
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,420
 membership were the ones

885
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,650
 who ended up developing

886
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,250
 friendships with other people

887
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,780
 there.

888
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,780
 And I think you're right.

889
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,140
 Ultimately, the thing that gets

890
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,220
 you to come back is like, do I

891
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,180
 enjoy coming here?

892
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,450
 Does it mean I get to see some

893
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,300
 of my friends?

894
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,450
 Does it mean I get to hang out

895
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,380
 with people I like?

896
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,460
 Or, you know, it's really the

897
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,750
 sense of belonging that gets

898
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,740
 habits to stick.

899
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,290
 And the action itself is just

900
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,920
 kind of like something that's

901
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,480
 happening along the way.

902
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 Yes.

903
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,730
 But there's a step before that

904
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,980
 that we kind of skipped over,

905
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,120
 which is like, how do you

906
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,010
 even choose a habit in the

907
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,200
 first place?

908
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
 Like how does that happen?

909
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,160
 In the sense of, I might not

910
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,920
 know what's good for me.

911
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,520
 So how does that come into this

912
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:15,520
?

913
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
 Yeah.

914
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,420
 Well, there are a lot of ways

915
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,360
 to answer that question.

916
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,590
 So I'll just share a couple of

917
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,920
 thoughts that come to mind.

918
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,490
 So the first thought that comes

919
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,070
 to mind is this question from,

920
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,300
 I first heard from Seth

921
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,920
 Godin, which I think is just a

922
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,750
 great question, which is, what

923
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,460
 is it for?

924
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,520
 And so this is a question that

925
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,610
 we need to ask ourselves when

926
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,540
 we're trying to build a

927
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,080
 new habit, which is, what is

928
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,100
 this habit for?

929
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,770
 What am I actually trying to

930
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,860
 achieve here?

931
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,490
 Because the correct habit to

932
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,250
 choose is very different based

933
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,940
 on what your goals are, what

934
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,710
 you're hoping to get as an

935
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,090
 outcome, what kind of lifestyle

936
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,020
 you want.

937
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,830
 And so for example, the habit

938
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,160
 of making 20 sales calls a day.

939
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,680
 Well, if what it's for is to

940
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,430
 increase revenue and to build a

941
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,280
 successful business, that's

942
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,880
 a wonderful thing.

943
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,490
 If you hate making sales calls

944
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,100
 and you want to spend less time

945
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,440
 working and more time with

946
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,700
 your family, that could be a

947
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,000
 terrible habit to build.

948
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,410
 It just depends on what it's

949
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,080
 for.

950
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,430
 So that's one question to ask,

951
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,400
 but you are correct that we

952
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,800
 often don't know what we need

953
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,440
 in the moment.

954
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,420
 And I think part of that is

955
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,600
 just a challenge of life and a

956
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,900
 challenge of self-awareness

957
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,650
 and knowing what you need, but

958
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,460
 life is a very complex system.

959
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,030
 And so figuring out the right

960
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,350
 thing for that is sometimes

961
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,780
 just impossible or too many

962
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,260
 moving

963
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
 parts.

964
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,820
 So I tend to default to two

965
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,100
 possible answers.

966
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,480
 The first answer is, we all

967
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,980
 need things that are so boring

968
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,900
 that we don't think about them,

969
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,150
 but are incredibly important

970
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,260
 for showing up each day.

971
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,860
 So did you sleep eight hours?

972
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,320
 Are you drinking enough water?

973
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,700
 Are you spending a little bit

974
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,970
 of time walking outside or

975
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,350
 getting a little bit of

976
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:52,840
 sunlight?

977
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,640
 Do you exercise consistently?

978
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,580
 Whatever form is interesting to

979
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,040
 you?

980
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,210
 Are you spending some time

981
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,390
 reading and soaking up new

982
00:25:59,390 --> 00:25:59,880
 ideas?

983
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,330
 I'm not saying you have to do

984
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,890
 all that stuff every day, but

985
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,480
 my point is those are things

986
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,920
 that most people would be like,

987
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,260
 "Yeah, of course, you should

988
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,480
 sleep and read more books

989
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
 and exercise.

990
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,680
 Everybody knows that's good."

991
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,400
 But your time is almost never

992
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,100
 going to be wasted by making

993
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,790
 sure you do one of those things

994
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,840
.

995
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,310
 It's a fundamental that's worth

996
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,680
 spending time on that's worth

997
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,020
 coming back to, that's worth

998
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,900
 reminding yourself of, even if

999
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,360
 you aren't sure the ideal

1000
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,940
 perfect place to focus in your

1001
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
 life.

1002
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,540
 So that's the first answer.

1003
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,220
 Come back to the fundamentals.

1004
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,310
 The second answer is more broad

1005
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,700
.

1006
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,030
 I can't be specific with it

1007
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,370
 because it depends on each

1008
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,510
 person, but the broad

1009
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,260
 application

1010
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,190
 is what I would call broad

1011
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,060
 funnel tight filter.

1012
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,700
 So whenever you're trying to

1013
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,460
 figure out where to focus, you

1014
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,160
 need a really broad range of

1015
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,090
 research, try to get as many

1016
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,370
 options as possible, then apply

1017
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,560
 a really tight strict filter to

1018
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,300
 it and just focus on the one or

1019
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,210
 two best options that you found

1020
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:57,520
.

1021
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,790
 So for example, I just finished

1022
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,860
 Atomic Habits a few months ago,

1023
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,520
 so now I'm thinking, "Should

1024
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,760
 I write a second book?

1025
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,510
 If I should, what should that

1026
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,320
 be about?"

1027
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,790
 And I don't know right now, so

1028
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,440
 I'm in the broad funnel stage.

1029
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,600
 So I want to lay out as many

1030
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,780
 options as possible.

1031
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,170
 I want to brainstorm a thousand

1032
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:14,700
 titles.

1033
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,110
 I want to look at all the top

1034
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,220
 books on Amazon.

1035
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,260
 I want to browse my best

1036
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,580
 performing tweets and see if

1037
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,060
 there's a possible thread for a

1038
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,060
 book idea in there.

1039
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,530
 I want to look everywhere I can

1040
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,990
 and just list all of that stuff

1041
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,380
 in the same spreadsheet.

1042
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,560
 And maybe I got 1200 ideas on

1043
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,540
 there, really broad funnel.

1044
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,510
 But then I need to apply a very

1045
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,740
 tight filter.

1046
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,590
 Is this something I'm

1047
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,790
 interested in enough to spend

1048
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,780
 two or three or four years

1049
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,260
 working

1050
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,260
 on?

1051
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,640
 Is it a topic of broad appeal

1052
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,960
 to a general audience?

1053
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,360
 Are there going to be a lot of

1054
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,720
 people that like this?

1055
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,590
 Is this something that I can

1056
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,450
 actually turn into something

1057
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,480
 actionable?

1058
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,960
 Can people use this in their

1059
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,760
 daily life?

1060
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,460
 Is this a topic that has a lot

1061
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,480
 of stories that I could tell?

1062
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,620
 Can I actually make this

1063
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,930
 entertaining or latch on to

1064
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,370
 other interesting stories to

1065
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:58,760
 make the

1066
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 book readable?

1067
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
 Yes.

1068
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,890
 And those are just some of the

1069
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,400
 filters.

1070
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,240
 But my point is that you want

1071
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,550
 some period of very broad

1072
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,560
 exploration, and then once you

1073
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,030
 have a lot of options, you want

1074
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,510
 to really tighten it down based

1075
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,740
 on that question, what

1076
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,740
 is this for?

1077
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,420
 So in my case, the question I'm

1078
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,090
 using is, well, it's for

1079
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,420
 writing a good book, one that's

1080
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,740
 highly actionable, one that

1081
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,100
 sells a lot of copies, one that

1082
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,420
 people find useful, and so

1083
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,420
 on.

1084
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,860
 And so I think if you combine

1085
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,440
 that broad funnel type filter

1086
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,100
 strategy and that question of

1087
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,740
 what is it for, that can maybe

1088
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,250
 give you some more specific

1089
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:30,980
 answers.

1090
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,280
 But even if you don't come up

1091
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,830
 with something good there, you

1092
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,910
 can always focus on the

1093
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,860
 fundamentals.

1094
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,940
 And the other thing, when you

1095
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,040
 mentioned Seth Godin, he has

1096
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,820
 this other line, which is

1097
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,440
 people

1098
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,320
 like us do things like this.

1099
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
 I love that line.

1100
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,020
 I wish I had thought it up, but

1101
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,320
 yeah, it's so good.

1102
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,480
 It's such a great mantra.

1103
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,580
 And what's interesting about it

1104
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,950
 is, like for me, one thing that

1105
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,720
 made me start thinking

1106
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,780
 about healthy habits was

1107
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,420
 hanging out with people who had

1108
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,060
 healthy habits.

1109
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,730
 And in some ways, it was really

1110
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,900
 lucky and fortunate, like you

1111
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,200
 guys invited me to that

1112
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,020
 retreat you did.

1113
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,670
 And in some ways, I'm thankful

1114
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,210
 you guys invited a loser like

1115
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,900
 me, because I was hanging out

1116
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,100
 in that group.

1117
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,120
 I came and at first I was

1118
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,240
 cynical and grumpy.

1119
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,810
 And eventually, just looking

1120
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,300
 around that group, I realized,

1121
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,340
 man, these people like this do

1122
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,960
 things like this.

1123
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,550
 And my cynicism, which before

1124
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,930
 it would have been like, wow,

1125
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,440
 people like that do stuff like

1126
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,160
 that.

1127
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,520
 It went down.

1128
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,140
 And then all of a sudden I was

1129
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,130
 like, okay, well, if people

1130
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,040
 like this do things like this,

1131
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,240
 that's what I need to do.

1132
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,300
 And I think for folks that are

1133
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,710
 thinking like, okay, well, how

1134
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,580
 do I know what good habits

1135
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
 are?

1136
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,970
 There are so many things that I

1137
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,690
 would have never been, what do

1138
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,220
 you call it?

1139
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,040
 There's the stages of habits or

1140
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,860
 whatever.

1141
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,500
 But I would have never even had

1142
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,850
 the cue if I had not first

1143
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,500
 observed it and then noticed

1144
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,590
 like, oh wait, they're doing

1145
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:18,940
 that.

1146
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,940
 They're doing that.

1147
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,940
 They're doing that.

1148
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,100
 I'm the odd man out.

1149
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,620
 And that's what motivated me to

1150
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,760
 want to pursue some of that

1151
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,600
 stuff.

1152
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,840
 But if I hadn't been in that

1153
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,150
 group and felt like, wait a

1154
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,450
 second, like, if I want to

1155
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:32,960
 belong

1156
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,680
 here, I've got to up my game,

1157
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,920
 right?

1158
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,640
 It would have never happened.

1159
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,550
 And so people like us do things

1160
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,170
 like this has been really

1161
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,400
 helpful for me.

1162
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,360
 Yeah, I love that phrase.

1163
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,380
 And one of the reasons I said

1164
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,540
 that, oh, I wish I had thought

1165
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,720
 that up, is because I think

1166
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,610
 it applies so deeply to a lot

1167
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,900
 of the ideas in Atomic Habits.

1168
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,490
 It applies to how socially

1169
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,060
 reinforced our habits are.

1170
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,130
 I think this is, you know, I

1171
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,380
 wrote about this in the book.

1172
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,550
 I mean, I have a whole chapter

1173
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:02,940
 on it.

1174
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,820
 Chapter nine is all about that.

1175
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,250
 But I think I still undersold

1176
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,430
 the importance of how socially

1177
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,540
 reinforced our habits are.

1178
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
 And then it also references the

1179
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,900
 importance of a shared identity

1180
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:15,900
.

1181
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,310
 I think that ultimately a

1182
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,000
 shared identity is really one

1183
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,760
 of the most powerful forces for

1184
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,280
 getting habits to stick.

1185
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,220
 You know, like if you look at,

1186
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,000
 if you look at it in a big way,

1187
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,240
 you can look at like religions,

1188
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,120
 you know, people, religions are

1189
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,750
 really interesting places to

1190
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,840
 look for habits.

1191
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,600
 People get in the habit of

1192
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,680
 going to church every Sunday

1193
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,200
 for 50 years, largely because

1194
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,520
 it's reinforced.

1195
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,870
 The other people in their

1196
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,670
 neighborhoods go, the people on

1197
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,400
 their block go, they see their

1198
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
 friends there.

1199
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,630
 They, it's a very socially

1200
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,460
 reinforced habit.

1201
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,150
 Same thing is true in smaller

1202
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,680
 ways.

1203
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,940
 Like let's say you move into a

1204
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,280
 new house and you walk outside

1205
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,460
 on Tuesday night and you

1206
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,110
 see all your neighbors have

1207
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,900
 their recycling bins out.

1208
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,310
 And you're like, huh, people

1209
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,780
 like us do things like this.

1210
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,870
 Like people who live in this

1211
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,230
 neighborhood recycle on Tuesday

1212
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,740
 nights.

1213
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,280
 I guess we need to sign up for

1214
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,180
 recycling.

1215
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,830
 And there are really almost an

1216
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,620
 infinite range of examples that

1217
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,140
 are like that, both large

1218
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,200
 and small, where our habits are

1219
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,040
, we notice them because the

1220
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,800
 people around us are doing

1221
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,210
 them, which is what the Q

1222
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,000
 portion is you referenced.

1223
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,920
 We desire to do them.

1224
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,810
 We crave to follow through on

1225
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,920
 them because by doing the same,

1226
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,360
 we fit in or signal to

1227
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,840
 the other people around us, Hey

1228
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,440
, I get it.

1229
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,000
 I'm part of the tribe too.

1230
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,260
 It becomes easier to do it

1231
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,640
 because sometimes you have

1232
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,140
 friends helping you out, you

1233
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,520
 know,

1234
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,220
 like it's like having a spotter

1235
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,000
 at the gym.

1236
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,830
 Like, Oh, people like us to

1237
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,770
 help each other out when a set

1238
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,420
 is hard.

1239
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,310
 And then ultimately it becomes

1240
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,130
 satisfying because you enjoy

1241
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,660
 being praised for it.

1242
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,990
 You know, other people are like

1243
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,050
, Hey, it was great to see you

1244
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,380
 at church on Sunday or, you

1245
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,540
 know, really good job on that

1246
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,380
 workout today.

1247
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,180
 And that feels good to be

1248
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,220
 praised for fitting in.

1249
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,760
 And so in that way, socially

1250
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,140
 reinforced habits or the

1251
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,730
 collective identity, it hits

1252
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,540
 all four

1253
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,840
 stages of habit formation.

1254
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,370
 And I knew that when I was

1255
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,370
 writing it, but I don't think I

1256
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,240
 gave it as much importance

1257
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,400
 as I should have.

1258
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,560
 It's a very powerful driver of

1259
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,720
 behavior in the long run.

1260
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
 Yeah, totally.

1261
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,380
 And I think this is why cyn

1262
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,360
icism is such a toxic attitude.

1263
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,850
 And you know, I'm, I guess I'm

1264
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,800
 in Gen X.

1265
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,040
 I'm born in 1980.

1266
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,010
 There's a lot of cynicism in

1267
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,620
 Gen X.

1268
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,450
 And then millennials also have

1269
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,060
 a little bit of this too.

1270
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,720
 And I think, and actually to be

1271
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,380
 honest, everybody has it.

1272
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,720
 Baby boomers have it when, you

1273
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,170
 know, if you're a 50 year old

1274
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,620
 programmer and you're, you get

1275
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,510
 hired at a startup where the

1276
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,450
 CEO is 20 years old, we kind of

1277
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,740
 default to cynicism.

1278
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,900
 And it, it, it's such a blocker

1279
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,130
 when you're like trying to

1280
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,780
 observe those norms like, Oh

1281
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,500
 wait, like people like us do

1282
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,760
 things like this.

1283
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,510
 Cynicism allows you to go, well

1284
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,840
, yeah, people like that do

1285
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,920
 stuff like that.

1286
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
 That's good for them.

1287
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,800
 That's good for James Clear.

1288
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,290
 But you know, that's not good

1289
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,120
 for me.

1290
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,660
 And when I'm trying to kind of

1291
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,350
 reveal from my experience for

1292
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,680
 anyone that ever watches

1293
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,810
 this or listens to this is that

1294
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,610
 you really do need to step

1295
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,520
 outside that and at least

1296
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,390
 be open to this idea that your

1297
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,700
 life could get better.

1298
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,470
 And it could just be going,

1299
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,670
 okay, well, I'm going to, I'm

1300
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,380
 going to vote for who I'm going

1301
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,500
 to be today and I'm going to

1302
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,610
 vote for who I'm going to be

1303
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,780
 tomorrow and I'm going to

1304
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,060
 keep going.

1305
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,210
 The other thing in the book

1306
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,560
 that really helped me and I'll

1307
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,680
 probably butcher it so you

1308
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,020
 clean

1309
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,540
 up after I do it, but you show

1310
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,660
 this grid.

1311
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,210
 So imagine like on this side of

1312
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,800
 your day, it's like, okay, I

1313
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,140
 make a good decision.

1314
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,700
 So it goes up.

1315
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,620
 And then I make another good

1316
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,080
 decision.

1317
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
 It goes up.

1318
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,440
 But then I make a bad decision.

1319
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,710
 Like I eat a tub of ice cream

1320
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,500
 and you know, sometimes eating

1321
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,880
 the tub of ice cream is like

1322
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
 debilitating.

1323
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
 It's like, well, I'm done.

1324
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,760
 I ate the tub of ice cream.

1325
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,040
 I suck at this.

1326
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,690
 I'm just going to go get into

1327
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,200
 bed and forget about it.

1328
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,640
 And in your grid, you show,

1329
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,480
 wait, but you're still up here.

1330
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,340
 Like you can just make another

1331
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,190
 good decision and then you're

1332
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,320
 back up again.

1333
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,120
 And I like that idea of kind of

1334
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,040
 navigating your ideas, not

1335
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,940
 being so hard on ourselves.

1336
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,940
 Did I kind of get that right?

1337
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
 Yeah.

1338
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,440
 So this is the, I don't know if

1339
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,940
 you can see it, but this is the

1340
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,500
 image.

1341
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,410
 But it's, it's a, it's this

1342
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,000
 idea that like the difference

1343
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,780
 between a good day and a bad

1344
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,170
 day is often just a series of

1345
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,260
 choices, right?

1346
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,600
 And you can win each little

1347
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,660
 moment, right?

1348
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,800
 You can win each decisive

1349
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,210
 moment just because you ate the

1350
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,580
 tub of ice cream doesn't mean

1351
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,540
 you can't win the next moment.

1352
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,680
 And, and so one thing that I

1353
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,880
 was thinking about when I wrote

1354
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,840
 that is this concept that

1355
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,680
 I call decisive moments.

1356
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,120
 This idea that there are a few

1357
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,390
 choices each day, maybe

1358
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,080
 somewhere between say five and

1359
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,260
 10 that kind of determine the

1360
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,720
 next chunk of time.

1361
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,960
 And so, so for example, there's

1362
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,910
 a moment for me each morning

1363
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,640
 where I sit down and either

1364
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,070
 I open up Evernote and I start

1365
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,400
 writing the next start.

1366
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,090
 I'll call, I'm going to work on

1367
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,520
, or I go to ESPN and I check

1368
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,120
 the latest sports news.

1369
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,960
 And what happens in the next

1370
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
 hour is really determined by

1371
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,940
 what happens in like the first

1372
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,940
 45 seconds.

1373
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,800
 You know, like, do I, do I go

1374
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,820
 to Evernote or do I go to ESPN?

1375
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,490
 And so that is a decisive

1376
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,300
 moment in my language.

1377
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,500
 That's like a moment that

1378
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,760
 determines if I can master

1379
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,370
 those 45 seconds, then I can

1380
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:47,660
 end

1381
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,490
 up mastering the next hour that

1382
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,900
 comes afterward almost

1383
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,100
 automatically.

1384
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
 Same thing is true.

1385
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,540
 There's a moment each night,

1386
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,190
 like 515 or so, my wife gets

1387
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,660
 home from work and either we

1388
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,660
 change into our workout clothes

1389
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,180
, or we like sit on the couch

1390
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,880
 and watch reruns the office

1391
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,130
 and order Indian food or

1392
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,880
 whatever.

1393
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,590
 And both of those nights are

1394
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,540
 good nights, but the moment to

1395
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,160
 master is do we change into

1396
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,440
 our workout clothes or not?

1397
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,240
 If we do that, it only takes a

1398
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,280
 few minutes.

1399
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,250
 Everything else for the next

1400
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,400
 two hours is already decided.

1401
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,560
 We'll get in the car, we'll

1402
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,800
 drive to the gym, we'll do the

1403
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,080
 reps, like it's all, it's all

1404
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,800
 pretty much done at that point.

1405
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,860
 So the reason I like bringing

1406
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,850
 that up or like thinking about

1407
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,640
 that is you start to really

1408
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,820
 realize there really isn't that

1409
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,980
 much that you need to master.

1410
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,570
 Really you just are trying to

1411
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,320
 focus your attention on a few

1412
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,060
 key decisive moments throughout

1413
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,060
 the day.

1414
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,670
 It's kind of like applying judo

1415
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,540
 to your life.

1416
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,850
 It's like apply the pressure

1417
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,100
 and the leverage at just the

1418
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,500
 right point and then the next

1419
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,550
 hour kind of falls into place

1420
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,980
 automatically.

1421
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,240
 And so I like that because once

1422
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,600
 you realize that, once you kind

1423
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,660
 of identify those high

1424
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,270
 leveraged decision points, you

1425
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,600
 can organize your day and your

1426
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,720
 environment around those

1427
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
 things.

1428
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,690
 If I know that those 45 seconds

1429
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,330
 where I'm choosing between E

1430
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,800
vernote or ESPN is a real

1431
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,140
 key moment, well, I could

1432
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,300
 install freedom and then I

1433
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,400
 could block ESPN from 8am to 10

1434
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,640
am

1435
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,690
 and that takes care of that

1436
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,570
 decisive moment and it

1437
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,650
 increases the odds that I'm

1438
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,240
 going to

1439
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,520
 open it instead.

1440
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,100
 But anyway, so little choices

1441
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,500
 like that are easier to make

1442
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,060
 once you've identified some

1443
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,220
 of those key points of leverage

1444
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,380
.

1445
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,910
 Yeah, and you talk in the book

1446
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,200
 like there's some tricks to

1447
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,280
 where you can make things

1448
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,180
 automatic.

1449
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,610
 You talk about Nira y'all

1450
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,190
 buying a little device that

1451
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,780
 just shuts off his internet

1452
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,220
 every

1453
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,220
 night at 10am.

1454
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,340
 Yeah, yeah, outlet timer.

1455
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,200
 Yeah, and what's brilliant

1456
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,230
 about that is like it shuts it

1457
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,020
 off, like especially if it's in

1458
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,260
 the basement or whatever, like

1459
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,090
 you're not going to go

1460
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,160
 downstairs and like fiddle

1461
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,520
 around

1462
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,090
 with it and then it's just,

1463
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,200
 that's what happens, right?

1464
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,360
 If ESPN was really killing you,

1465
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,370
 you could just cancel your

1466
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,040
 cable subscription, that

1467
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,070
 might be a bit, but then you go

1468
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,320
 to watch ESPN, you can't, right

1469
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,680
?

1470
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,080
 It's done.

1471
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,050
 By the way, you mentioned this

1472
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,790
 in the book too, but it's so

1473
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,680
 funny how certain people's,

1474
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,000
 it is a trigger for some people

1475
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,980
 is not for others.

1476
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,530
 Like ESPN for me is not a, that

1477
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,060
's not a temptation at all.

1478
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,150
 Yeah, it doesn't even enter

1479
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,940
 your worldview.

1480
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,900
 Doesn't enter my worldview, but

1481
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,650
 it shows you how identity is so

1482
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,940
 much a part of this.

1483
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,410
 If I was hanging out with a

1484
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,950
 bunch of Oilers fans every

1485
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,860
 single day, and this happened

1486
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:32,980
 in

1487
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,330
 the co-work office, there's a

1488
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,940
 few people and they're watching

1489
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,700
 Oilers games on their computers

1490
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:40,860
,

1491
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,290
 but I realized like if I want

1492
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,700
 to talk to them, I've got to

1493
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,480
 start watching Oilers games.

1494
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,820
 So people like us do things

1495
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,560
 like this.

1496
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,950
 And so I started developing

1497
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,450
 this habit of watching Oilers

1498
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,960
 games when, before I didn't

1499
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
 even care.

1500
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,350
 I think that, I mean, I think

1501
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,710
 this is one of the reasons why

1502
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,000
 sports is so tribal, why

1503
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,750
 people get so emotional about

1504
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,190
 it, is that it becomes a

1505
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,620
 connection point for the

1506
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,680
 relationships.

1507
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,900
 It's not even, the game is

1508
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,410
 actually, no one would ever say

1509
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,840
 that because everybody acts

1510
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,020
 like the game is the thing that

1511
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,880
 matters the most.

1512
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,320
 But in a weird way, it's kind

1513
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,580
 of a secondary thing.

1514
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,710
 Really, like when I think back

1515
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,630
 for me, sports is a way for my

1516
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,500
 brother and I to connect and

1517
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,610
 for us to have something to

1518
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,660
 text about and chat about

1519
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,740
 throughout the week.

1520
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,000
 It's a thing that, it's a

1521
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,380
 reason for my dad and I to get

1522
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,740
 together in person and to go

1523
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,180
 to games and hang out.

1524
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,160
 And like it's all the other

1525
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,250
 stuff that it provides that

1526
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,860
 makes it so deeply meaningful.

1527
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,300
 And then you end up assigning a

1528
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,670
 lot of that emotion to how the

1529
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,860
 team does on the field

1530
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,220
 as well, you know, the scores

1531
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,240
 on the scoreboard.

1532
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,580
 But yeah, it's a good example

1533
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,320
 there.

1534
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,890
 On that topic then, and this is

1535
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,180
 Corey Stone is asking this in

1536
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,440
 chat, but there's a lot

1537
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,890
 of people on Twitter that ask

1538
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:49,480
 this too.

1539
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,640
 Given that example that you

1540
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,410
 just gave, if your meaningful

1541
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,520
 relationships are engaging in

1542
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
 habits that might not be good

1543
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,220
 for you or that you want to

1544
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,430
 change, how do you navigate

1545
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,840
 that?

1546
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,960
 So if you're really feeling

1547
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,690
 like I got to stop watching

1548
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,740
 sports, it's just like I get

1549
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,720
 a little bit and then I just go

1550
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,880
 crazy, but I still want to have

1551
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,420
 a relationship with my

1552
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,060
 brother.

1553
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,420
 This is where it gets complex,

1554
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,800
 especially if you're married to

1555
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,500
 somebody.

1556
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,400
 If your wife is at least

1557
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,880
 somewhat inclined to want to go

1558
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,380
 to the gym, I'm guessing.

1559
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,740
 But if she was like, no, I just

1560
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,090
 want to watch Netflix and order

1561
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,860
 Indian food.

1562
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,980
 That's all I want to do.

1563
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,130
 How do you start to navigate

1564
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:32,840
 those things?

1565
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,780
 Yeah, those are good questions.

1566
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,290
 I mean, it's really hard

1567
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,020
 because especially if it's a

1568
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,860
 person who you want to stay in

1569
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,020
 your

1570
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,390
 life, you know, I think first

1571
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,680
 of all, I just want to say, so

1572
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,880
 I have some things I want

1573
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,180
 to add to this, but I feel like

1574
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,370
 it's worth noting that this

1575
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,480
 question comes up a lot.

1576
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,350
 And I think the reason it comes

1577
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,140
 up a lot is because we all know

1578
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,880
 that actually there isn't

1579
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,480
 a good, easy answer and that it

1580
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,250
's like just a hard part of life

1581
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:00,280
.

1582
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
 You know what I mean?

1583
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,640
 Like everybody wants, it's one

1584
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,900
 of those things we want to keep

1585
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,260
 asking about in hopes that,

1586
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,390
 oh, maybe there'll be an easy

1587
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,300
 way to resolve this.

1588
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,950
 But I think we all know like it

1589
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,420
's a challenge.

1590
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,760
 Now that said, there are a few

1591
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,660
 things you can do.

1592
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,290
 So first thing is sometimes

1593
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,120
 your friends and family want to

1594
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,900
 do something different than

1595
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,420
 how you want to change.

1596
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,260
 So like you want to stick to a

1597
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,320
 new diet, they want to eat the

1598
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,060
 old way or something like

1599
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,060
 that.

1600
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,490
 So you want to start doing yoga

1601
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,040
, they couldn't care less about

1602
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,580
 yoga.

1603
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,930
 They don't want to go to class

1604
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:32,540
 with you.

1605
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,540
 Things like that.

1606
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,430
 Well, if that's the case, then

1607
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,260
 for certain habits, you don't

1608
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,940
 have to like fire your friends

1609
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,310
 and family to be able to do

1610
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,620
 that.

1611
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,120
 But what you can, what you do

1612
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,770
 need or what can be really

1613
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,080
 useful is having like a sacred

1614
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,090
 space where that occurs where I

1615
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,530
'm not saying you need to do

1616
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,360
 this with me, but just don't

1617
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,880
 make it harder on me, right?

1618
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,220
 Just don't conflict with.

1619
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,560
 So the yoga example is an

1620
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,170
 easier one where it's like,

1621
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,020
 well, maybe you need to go to a

1622
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,600
 yoga studio away from the

1623
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,560
 friends and family that aren't

1624
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,540
 interested and start to build

1625
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,420
 friendships with people who are

1626
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,580
.

1627
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,560
 I'm not saying you need to get

1628
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,600
 rid of your old friends, but

1629
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,500
 maybe it'd be helpful to

1630
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,870
 build a couple of new ones who

1631
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,240
 are into yoga so that you have

1632
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,580
 like a safe space for that

1633
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,580
 habit to live.

1634
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,700
 So that's one thing.

1635
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,370
 Then there's the second piece,

1636
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,750
 which is sometimes you're

1637
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,400
 building a habit that you do

1638
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,020
 want the

1639
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,780
 person to like join you on to

1640
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,300
 come along with you.

1641
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,470
 You're working out and you

1642
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,740
 would love for your spouse to

1643
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,630
 join you at the gym or

1644
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,200
 something

1645
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,580
 like that.

1646
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,150
 Everybody know it like it would

1647
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,590
 be good, but maybe they feel

1648
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,140
 less comfortable there than

1649
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,140
 you do.

1650
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,010
 Or maybe they feel you were

1651
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,230
 previously an athlete and they

1652
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,140
 were not.

1653
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,940
 And so you feel kind of

1654
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,980
 comfortable in the gym.

1655
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,300
 You've been there before in

1656
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,720
 years past, but for them it's

1657
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,100
 like new and weird and they

1658
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,260
 feel

1659
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,120
 like they're being judged and

1660
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,980
 whatever.

1661
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,380
 If you're dealing with a case

1662
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,310
 like that, the thing that I try

1663
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,660
 to keep in mind and I can

1664
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,390
 tell you from working with my

1665
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,660
 own family, it can be

1666
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,700
 incredibly useful is praise the

1667
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,820
 good ignore the bad.

1668
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,260
 It's very hard to do.

1669
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,950
 It's very the difficult part

1670
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,560
 about it is not doing it on an

1671
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,900
 individual basis.

1672
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,340
 It's that this needs to be the

1673
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,640
 new lifestyle for you.

1674
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,420
 So when they do the thing that

1675
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,270
 you're asking them to do, don't

1676
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,860
 basically another way to

1677
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,750
 phrase this is don't criticize

1678
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,850
 people for doing what you were

1679
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,940
 hoping they would.

1680
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,360
 There are so many times when

1681
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,700
 the introverted kid in the

1682
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,120
 family will come down to the

1683
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,620
 dinner

1684
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,040
 table and it's like, oh, look

1685
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,220
 who decided to join us.

1686
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,120
 It's like, well, they finally

1687
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,660
 did the thing that you were

1688
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,620
 hoping they would do and engage

1689
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,860
 with everybody.

1690
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,840
 And now they just feel like

1691
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,050
 they're getting criticized for

1692
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:39,300
 it.

1693
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,510
 Or you go to the gym and your

1694
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,040
 spouse decides to join you and

1695
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,300
 they do a few sets and then

1696
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,300
 they feel like they're done.

1697
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,860
 And you say, well, that was a

1698
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,260
 pretty short workout.

1699
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,880
 And what you should be saying

1700
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,480
 is I think it's great that you

1701
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,300
 got in here tonight, right?

1702
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,560
 Like you weren't feeling it,

1703
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,810
 but you were still able to make

1704
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,260
 it in.

1705
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,120
 And so praise the good ignore

1706
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,220
 the bad.

1707
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,030
 And if you can do that in the

1708
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,590
 long run, what ends up

1709
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,670
 happening is everybody likes

1710
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,380
 feeling

1711
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,380
 praised.

1712
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,680
 Everybody likes feeling

1713
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,380
 rewarded.

1714
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,170
 It feels satisfying to do

1715
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,930
 something that the people who

1716
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,860
 love you and who are around you

1717
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,460
 praise you for.

1718
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,600
 And so at first you go to the

1719
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,720
 gym and they say, hey, I'm

1720
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,180
 really proud of you for getting

1721
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,180
 in here tonight.

1722
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,180
 Good job.

1723
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,180
 And it doesn't seem like much.

1724
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,460
 But then after two months and

1725
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,950
 three months and 10 months of

1726
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,340
 that, you turn around a year

1727
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,620
 later and they might never even

1728
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,380
 say it.

1729
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,760
 But implicitly what they've

1730
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,370
 realized is, damn, every time I

1731
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,060
 go to the gym, it feels good.

1732
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,820
 They compliment me.

1733
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,280
 And that so now all of a sudden

1734
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,880
 you start to associate going to

1735
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,060
 the gym with feeling

1736
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,180
 good.

1737
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,860
 And this is a really long game

1738
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,540
 play because it takes a while

1739
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,140
 for that to reinforce itself.

1740
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,160
 But same thing like the intro

1741
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,100
verted kid at the table sits

1742
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,140
 down and they say something

1743
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,140
 that happened today.

1744
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:57,840
 And it's like, oh, that's

1745
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,140
 awesome.

1746
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,000
 Thanks for sharing that with us

1747
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,140
.

1748
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,770
 And like on that individual

1749
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,810
 night, that one night at dinner

1750
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,340
 doesn't count for a lot.

1751
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,110
 But if every time they speak up

1752
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,990
, they're rewarded for it, then

1753
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,540
 all of a sudden now they have

1754
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,790
 a reason to start doing that

1755
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,220
 more in the months and years to

1756
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:12,620
 come.

1757
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,500
 So it takes a while.

1758
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,810
 But I think that that's like an

1759
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,080
 effective way to gradually n

1760
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,260
udge people in the right

1761
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,260
 direction.

1762
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,260
 Yeah.

1763
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,150
 There's someone in the chat

1764
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,010
 that's saying they need to

1765
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,060
 apply that idea to themselves

1766
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,960
 to avoid feeling guilty for not

1767
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,020
 doing enough.

1768
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,720
 So instead of reinforce, oh,

1769
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,390
 you idiot, you didn't go to the

1770
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,180
 gym again.

1771
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,180
 You fatty.

1772
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,120
 You know, like that's not

1773
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,940
 helpful.

1774
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,650
 Because the self talk, it can

1775
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,340
 work with self talk as well.

1776
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,880
 This is why I think small

1777
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,790
 habits can be so useful in some

1778
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,900
 ways, even on the bad days,

1779
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,160
 because like, let's say you're

1780
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,390
 in that situation you just said

1781
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,780
 where it's like, oh, you know,

1782
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,780
 skip the gym again.

1783
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,780
 Yeah.

1784
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,300
 Well, you can still do one push

1785
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,790
 up or one air squat or whatever

1786
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:52,860
 before you go do a set

1787
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,790
 of 10 air squats before you hop

1788
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:55,860
 in bed tonight.

1789
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,550
 And it's not going to transform

1790
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,970
 your body, but that's not

1791
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,180
 really the point.

1792
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,450
 The point is to prove to

1793
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,140
 yourself that it wasn't a good

1794
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:03,660
 day.

1795
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,740
 I didn't have the best

1796
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,020
 motivation or energy.

1797
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,700
 I had a long day at work, but I

1798
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,460
 still am not the type of person

1799
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,980
 who misses workouts.

1800
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,540
 I still proved to myself.

1801
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,130
 I still cast a vote for being

1802
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,300
 that kind of person.

1803
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,590
 I didn't let a day go by

1804
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,260
 without doing nothing.

1805
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,690
 And that can count for a lot in

1806
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:22,060
 the long run.

1807
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,670
 And so sometimes small habits

1808
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,340
 are less about the outcome they

1809
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,820
 deliver and more about the

1810
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,420
 identity they reinforce.

1811
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,420
 Yeah.

1812
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,510
 So I actually found, you know,

1813
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,900
 another thing I tried to, I'm

1814
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,540
 implementing in the new year

1815
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,760
 is I decided to quit drinking

1816
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,740
 alcohol.

1817
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,240
 And right now it's ostensibly

1818
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,510
 for this goal of hitting a

1819
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,940
 revenue mark once I hit the

1820
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,100
 goal,

1821
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,460
 then I can have a drink.

1822
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,740
 But the deeper motivation for

1823
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,270
 me was I just realized like it

1824
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,580
 just makes, it's a depressant.

1825
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,270
 It's like there's a bunch of

1826
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,010
 reasons that it's not good for

1827
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:58,460
 me.

1828
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,580
 And so my excuse or my way of

1829
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,170
 trying it out is saying, well,

1830
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,420
 I'm going for this goal.

1831
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,630
 But it's been interesting in

1832
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,940
 social situations because all

1833
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,420
 my friends still drink and that

1834
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:09,420
's

1835
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,900
 fine with me.

1836
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,800
 But sometimes just sharing the

1837
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,690
 goal, oh, I'm just doing this

1838
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,420
 because I'm going after this

1839
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,940
 thing.

1840
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,500
 And you talk about how goals

1841
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,020
 are sometimes helpful in

1842
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,940
 setting your direction, you

1843
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,140
 know,

1844
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,050
 like, okay, I'm pointed this

1845
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,140
 way now.

1846
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,910
 And sometimes sharing that with

1847
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,140
 people is helpful.

1848
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,550
 The other thing is, I think

1849
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,160
 eventually if I just keep doing

1850
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,620
 this, just for me to say,

1851
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,140
 well, I'm a non-drinker now.

1852
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,380
 And so I can still go and have

1853
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,640
 my favorite, and it's also nice

1854
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,420
 having a thing that you

1855
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,420
 like.

1856
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,370
 So my favorite non-alcoholic

1857
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,490
 drink is a non-alcoholic Caesar

1858
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:48,820
.

1859
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,940
 It's like a Bloody Mary.

1860
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,210
 And to have that drink, it's

1861
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,900
 like kind of spicy.

1862
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,540
 There's a reward there.

1863
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,710
 I also have this social crutch

1864
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,810
 that I can use in a situation,

1865
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:01,820
 you know.

1866
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,410
 And if somebody asks me about

1867
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,680
 it, I also have this new

1868
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,480
 identity, which is, oh, I'm a

1869
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,260
 non-drinker

1870
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,260
 now.

1871
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,340
 I just don't drink.

1872
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,820
 And you talked about that.

1873
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,700
 There's some research behind

1874
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:11,980
 that.

1875
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,410
 I know you've mentioned it a

1876
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,040
 lot, but it's like I'm trying

1877
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,420
 to quit smoking versus I'm

1878
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,700
 a non-smoker, right?

1879
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,700
 Is that correct?

1880
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,700
 Correct, right?

1881
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,700
 Yeah.

1882
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,710
 So I think that can be really

1883
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,660
 helpful.

1884
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,660
 Yeah.

1885
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,500
 Having, I think what you're

1886
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,940
 explaining here, the situation

1887
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,940
 that you're going through, this

1888
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,430
 experience you're having, is

1889
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,030
 kind of, it's illustrating this

1890
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,620
 process of identity change,

1891
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,620
 right?

1892
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,540
 It started with, oh, I'm just

1893
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,130
 going to put it off for a

1894
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:39,770
 little while while I'm

1895
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:40,180
 attacking

1896
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,180
 this goal.

1897
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,410
 But then you're casting so many

1898
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,680
 votes for like, you know what,

1899
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,900
 I haven't drank and like,

1900
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,060
 I'm kind of benefiting from it.

1901
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,020
 Like maybe this is part of my

1902
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:47,660
 identity now.

1903
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,420
 Maybe I'm a non-drinker.

1904
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,590
 And so anyway, yeah, I think

1905
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,830
 you're definitely on the right

1906
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:53,580
 track there.

1907
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,580
 Yeah.

1908
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,080
 And actually, this is a good

1909
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,530
 time to bring up two Twitter

1910
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,380
 questions.

1911
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,870
 Maria Aldry asks, you know, how

1912
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,700
 do you maintain habits?

1913
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,030
 Ask him about maintaining

1914
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,170
 habits for people with

1915
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,560
 depression, anxiety, or

1916
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,780
 attention deficit.

1917
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,640
 Do you want to try to tackle

1918
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,180
 that?

1919
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,700
 Yeah.

1920
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,230
 So I've tried to be careful

1921
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,930
 about saying that atomic habits

1922
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,620
 is about building habits and

1923
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,500
 breaking bad habits, building

1924
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,300
 good ones.

1925
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:21,980
 But it's not a book on

1926
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,500
 addiction.

1927
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,700
 It's not a book on depression.

1928
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,130
 It's not a book about anxiety

1929
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,460
 or ADHD or any of these other

1930
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,780
 disorders or ailments.

1931
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,450
 And I don't consider myself an

1932
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,820
 expert on addiction.

1933
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,310
 However, something interesting

1934
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,060
 has happened.

1935
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,800
 So I published the book and I

1936
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,390
 have had a ton of speaking

1937
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,940
 requests recently.

1938
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,350
 And so I've been doing speeches

1939
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,700
 at conferences and companies

1940
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,830
 and different events and

1941
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:45,780
 whatever.

1942
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,100
 And so many times, I get

1943
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,590
 someone that comes up to me

1944
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,920
 afterward or that asks a

1945
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,580
 question

1946
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,960
 during Q&A that talks about how

1947
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,150
 useful the book was for their

1948
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,100
 son who had ADHD or their

1949
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,420
 cousin was a meth addict and

1950
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,900
 then was able to like start to,

1951
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,260
 you know, write the ship

1952
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,300
 by employing some of these

1953
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,500
 techniques or whatever.

1954
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,500
 Yeah.

1955
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
 Which is great, which is very

1956
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,060
 gratifying.

1957
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,450
 I still stand by my original

1958
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:08,220
 statement.

1959
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,580
 I'm not an expert on addiction.

1960
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,840
 I don't want to like take a

1961
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,580
 strong stance with this stuff.

1962
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,060
 But what I've realized is that

1963
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,020
 the principles that I lay out

1964
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,700
 in atomic habits are really

1965
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,220
 about how human behavior works.

1966
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,790
 It's about how habits are

1967
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,500
 formed.

1968
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,710
 And whether that habit is

1969
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,100
 something extreme, like an

1970
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,610
 addiction or picking your skin

1971
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:26,820
 or

1972
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,800
 OCD or ADHD or whatever, or

1973
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,900
 whether it's something more

1974
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,160
 moderate like meditating for

1975
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,660
 three minutes

1976
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,160
 a day.

1977
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,840
 The fundamentals tend to be

1978
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,620
 similar.

1979
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,000
 And so I'm not going to say

1980
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,180
 that the book offers a

1981
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,040
 prescription for overcoming add

1982
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,700
ictions.

1983
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,340
 But what I will say is you'd be

1984
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,760
 hard pressed to find tactics in

1985
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,020
 the book that wouldn't

1986
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,580
 at least help, right?

1987
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,260
 They wouldn't at least nudge

1988
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,260
 people in the right direction.

1989
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,300
 I have heard from a few readers

1990
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,550
 who specifically have said that

1991
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,460
 they had ADHD and they found

1992
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,040
 the book very helpful.

1993
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,300
 Environment design for whatever

1994
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,470
 reason has been something that

1995
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,460
's come up multiple times

1996
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,850
 for folks who have struggled

1997
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:06,540
 with that.

1998
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,370
 So I think it's kind of like if

1999
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,220
 you're the type of person who

2000
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,780
 is less likely to just

2001
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,540
 remember to do it, right?

2002
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,900
 Or just follow your to-do list.

2003
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,720
 If that's not you, then struct

2004
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,620
uring an environment where it's

2005
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,420
 easier to see the cues of your

2006
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,310
 good habits, less likely to see

2007
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,340
 the distractions, less friction

2008
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,770
 between you and the good

2009
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:27,700
 behavior,

2010
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,040
 more friction between you and

2011
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,780
 the bad ones.

2012
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,150
 If you place yourself in that

2013
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,570
 space, it's much more likely

2014
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:33,860
 that you're going to fall

2015
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,860
 through.

2016
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,290
 You know, those are things that

2017
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,670
 I talk about in chapters 6 and

2018
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,260
 12.

2019
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,800
 But I think that the book

2020
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,710
 applies, but I don't pitch it

2021
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,510
 as like a prescription for

2022
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:43,820
 someone

2023
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,130
 dealing with a more serious

2024
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:45,620
 issue.

2025
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,620
 Totally.

2026
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,770
 Yeah, and I would say, again, I

2027
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,730
'm not an expert either, but as

2028
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,300
 someone who has been dealing

2029
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,490
 with depression the past couple

2030
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,600
 years, having a professional

2031
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,820
 that you go to that deals with

2032
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,980
 this stuff all the time like a

2033
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,100
 therapist is so helpful.

2034
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,740
 And the therapist will be very

2035
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,380
 interested if you read James'

2036
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,180
 book.

2037
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,970
 So I said to my therapist, I'm

2038
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,590
 like, you know, she starts way

2039
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,420
 back here.

2040
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,670
 And then she says, "So what's

2041
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,420
 new with you?"

2042
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,410
 I'm like, "Well, you know, I

2043
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,440
 read this book and I'm thinking

2044
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,460
, oh, what are you thinking

2045
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,460
 about doing with that?"

2046
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,670
 "Oh, I'm thinking about maybe

2047
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,020
 quitting alcohol."

2048
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,030
 "Oh, well, that's, you know,

2049
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,030
 there's some reinforcement from

2050
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,540
 the professionals."

2051
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,230
 And likewise with my doctor,

2052
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,610
 you know, when I had depression

2053
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,020
 and I went to my physician,

2054
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,180
 she said, she gave me two pres

2055
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,520
criptions, quit drinking alcohol

2056
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,980
 and quit taking any kind

2057
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,260
 of cannabis.

2058
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,000
 And the reason is she says, "

2059
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,820
Those are going to make you feel

2060
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,460
 bad."

2061
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,850
 Now the trigger in that case

2062
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:54,740
 was my doctor.

2063
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,470
 It's nice when you have a

2064
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,600
 doctor saying, "Listen, this is

2065
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,420
 your prescription."

2066
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,830
 Oh, and double the amount of

2067
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,060
 exercise I was doing.

2068
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,900
 So three things.

2069
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,450
 Those, so I did that for three

2070
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,960
 months and then, you know, I

2071
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,500
 went back to my old habits.

2072
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,310
 But now I have that memory of

2073
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,450
 what it was like for three

2074
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,300
 months and it's been a powerful

2075
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,560
 trigger for me to, you know,

2076
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,330
 when I am starting to notice my

2077
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,000
 mood go down, I can, I

2078
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,980
 remembered,

2079
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,360
 you know, my doctor's

2080
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,580
 prescription was quit drinking,

2081
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,640
 quit, you know, eating edibles

2082
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,420
 and

2083
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,660
 doubling my exercise.

2084
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,720
 And that's been helpful for me

2085
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,340
 personally.

2086
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,690
 So I think if you're reading

2087
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,350
 the book, let your professional

2088
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,540
 in your life know about

2089
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,540
 it.

2090
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,540
 It's good.

2091
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,300
 And one thing I want you to do

2092
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,460
 is, because I love the imagery,

2093
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,300
 but, and this is probably

2094
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,870
 unfair to you, is to give the

2095
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,450
 ice cube example, but use

2096
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,500
 Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.

2097
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,540
 So this is an example from the

2098
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,660
 first chapter of the book.

2099
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,790
 And I actually, as a side note,

2100
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:57,700
 I thought about this.

2101
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,780
 I was like, man, we're going to

2102
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,740
 have to get these changed for

2103
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,660
 the foreign editions.

2104
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,590
 Like we're going to, it's going

2105
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,580
 to need to be, but anyway, so.

2106
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,580
 Yeah, I think you can do that.

2107
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,580
 Yeah.

2108
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,580
 Yeah.

2109
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,920
 The core idea is that the

2110
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,750
 process of changing your habits

2111
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,660
 is, well, it's similar to what

2112
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,840
 we talked about early on, that

2113
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,890
 there's often this valley of

2114
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,780
 death, that there's this period

2115
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,950
 where you're just kind of

2116
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,420
 building up latent potential,

2117
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,980
 but you're not really releasing

2118
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,900
 any other results yet.

2119
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,580
 And I like to equate it to the

2120
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,290
 process of heating up an ice

2121
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:24,700
 cube.

2122
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,590
 So you've got this ice cube

2123
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,180
 sitting on a table.

2124
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,480
 And so let's say it's like

2125
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,400
 negative three degrees in there

2126
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:31,460
.

2127
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,200
 So you're at negative three, it

2128
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,940
's cold, you can see your breath

2129
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,380
, the ice cube's sitting

2130
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,030
 there, you heated up negative

2131
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,300
 two, negative one.

2132
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,620
 Still, there's this ice cube

2133
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,460
 sitting there.

2134
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,620
 Nothing has happened.

2135
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,070
 Then you go from negative one

2136
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:45,660
 to zero.

2137
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,130
 And all of a sudden, you have

2138
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,470
 this one degree shift, no

2139
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,060
 different than any of the other

2140
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,950
 shifts that came before it, but

2141
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,980
 you have this phase transition,

2142
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,500
 right?

2143
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,720
 And like the ice cube starts

2144
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,020
 melting.

2145
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,780
 And that I think is indicative

2146
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,460
 of what it often feels like to

2147
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,620
 change a habit.

2148
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,880
 You're making these little

2149
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,460
 improvements, you're trying to

2150
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,910
 make these 1% changes, these

2151
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:06,020
 one

2152
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,660
 degree shifts each day.

2153
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,150
 And you're like, it's really

2154
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,700
 easy to get frustrated or even

2155
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,100
 depressed at that point.

2156
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,320
 You know, it's like, I've been

2157
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,530
 running for three weeks, how

2158
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:16,500
 come I can't see a change

2159
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
 in my body?

2160
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,950
 Or I've been writing blog posts

2161
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,220
 for six months now, how come

2162
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,580
 this site isn't popular yet?

2163
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,560
 And the key point there is your

2164
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,590
 work was not being wasted, it's

2165
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,140
 just being stored.

2166
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,810
 Complaining about sticking to a

2167
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,340
 habit for two months or three

2168
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,660
 months or even six months

2169
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,970
 or a year and not having the

2170
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,400
 outcome that you want is kind

2171
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,740
 of like complaining about

2172
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,210
 heating an ice cube from

2173
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,130
 negative three to negative one

2174
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,060
 degrees and not melting it.

2175
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,370
 The work was not wasted, it's

2176
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,380
 just being stored.

2177
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,440
 And I love that quote that's in

2178
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,470
 that same section from Jacob

2179
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,140
 Reese, who it hangs in

2180
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,410
 the locker room of the San

2181
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,040
 Antonio Recruitment, won five

2182
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,300
 NBA championships.

2183
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,560
 And it says essentially, when I

2184
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,100
 feel like giving up, I think

2185
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,580
 about the stone cutter

2186
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,530
 who continues to hammer away at

2187
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,090
 the stone a hundred times

2188
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,740
 without it splitting.

2189
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,880
 And then finally, on the 101st

2190
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,460
 blow, it cracks in two.

2191
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,700
 And I know that it wasn't the

2192
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,900
 hundred that can't there.

2193
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,430
 I know it wasn't the 101st

2194
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,680
 swing that did it, but the

2195
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,180
 hundred that came before.

2196
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,020
 And like it's that same idea.

2197
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,630
 You know, the reason the site

2198
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,240
 takes off is not because of the

2199
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,700
 one viral article, it's

2200
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,450
 because of the 55 that you

2201
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,130
 wrote in the weeks and months

2202
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:25,740
 prior.

2203
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,070
 The reason that you see a

2204
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,470
 change in your body is not

2205
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,890
 because today's workout

2206
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:30,540
 radically

2207
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,070
 transform you, it's because you

2208
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,280
've been sticking to it for

2209
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,300
 eight months now.

2210
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,470
 And it's really about showing

2211
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,090
 up, continue to put those

2212
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:40,180
 swings in, continue to raise

2213
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,100
 the temperature by one degree.

2214
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,450
 And eventually you hit that

2215
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,920
 phase transition where you can

2216
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,500
 see the results of your work.

2217
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,500
 Yeah.

2218
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,050
 And that image has been so

2219
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,420
 powerful in my life.

2220
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,420
 The re like I've been telling

2221
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,050
 people about this book and I

2222
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,940
 actually notice there's kind

2223
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,700
 of like a coffee shop test.

2224
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,190
 Like if I hear people talking

2225
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,810
 about something from Internet

2226
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,280
 culture in a coffee shop, like

2227
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,050
 real people, then something's

2228
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,220
 hit and atomic habits is like

2229
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:09,940
 that.

2230
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,240
 Like it hit the kind of

2231
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,570
 mainstream and that image of

2232
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,570
 just raising the temperature a

2233
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:19,380
 little

2234
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,700
 bit every day.

2235
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,300
 Now I feel like I'm a few

2236
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,480
 months into this and I'm a

2237
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,170
 little bit kind of like

2238
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,860
 evangelical

2239
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,860
 about it.

2240
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,370
 And now I'm like, God, like my

2241
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,480
 life is so much better.

2242
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,650
 And it's because of just these

2243
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,900
 little changes over time in the

2244
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,400
 same direction.

2245
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,920
 I can now I can see it.

2246
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,430
 Now I can see that I feel

2247
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:47,200
 better.

2248
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,580
 You know, wow, man, quitting

2249
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,160
 alcohol.

2250
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
 That was one thing.

2251
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,440
 And then wow, showing up at the

2252
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,770
 gym three or four times a week,

2253
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,800
 that really helps.

2254
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,100
 And wow, like reading a real

2255
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,470
 book every night before I go to

2256
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:56,880
 bed.

2257
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,810
 All of these things keep kind

2258
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,420
 of adding up and do make a

2259
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,620
 meaningful difference in your

2260
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,820
 life.

2261
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,830
 Even though way back when when

2262
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,000
 you're starting, you feel like,

2263
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,260
 well, nothing's going to help

2264
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,260
 me now.

2265
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,410
 It's I want to be clear that

2266
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,750
 this these ideas have meaning

2267
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,980
fully impacted my life.

2268
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,410
 So I'm yeah, I'm really

2269
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:19,260
 thankful.

2270
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,270
 I'm thankful you wrote that

2271
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:20,540
 book.

2272
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,400
 I'm thankful you you talked to

2273
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,540
 me in the airport.

2274
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,140
 It's been really great for me.

2275
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,440
 That's awesome.

2276
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,430
 Thank you so much for sharing

2277
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,760
 that.

2278
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,170
 And ultimately, that's what the

2279
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,480
 whole thing is for, right?

2280
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,690
 I mean, it just it makes it

2281
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:32,860
 feel like it was worth the

2282
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,080
 effort to spend a few years

2283
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,560
 writing

2284
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,560
 it and working on it.

2285
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,560
 So that's great.

2286
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,150
 And so before you go, some

2287
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,830
 people are asking like what

2288
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,590
 recommendations for system

2289
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:42,760
 services,

2290
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,080
 tools, trackers.

2291
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,150
 I know you have a new one

2292
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:45,880
 coming out.

2293
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,880
 Do you want to talk about that?

2294
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,880
 Sure.

2295
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,880
 Yeah.

2296
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,450
 So I got it right here next to

2297
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:49,880
 me, actually.

2298
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,680
 So this is a habit journal.

2299
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,240
 And we we just launched it two

2300
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,460
 weeks ago.

2301
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,050
 And it's got it's basically a

2302
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,340
 dot grid notebook.

2303
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,490
 So if you're into bullet journ

2304
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,640
aling or you're into keeping a

2305
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,020
 notebook or use a notebook,

2306
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,560
 the vast majority of it are dot

2307
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,260
 grid pages.

2308
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,470
 So you'll be able to use it

2309
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:06,580
 like any normal one.

2310
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,250
 But then at the back, there's a

2311
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,780
 section with a habit tracker

2312
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,620
 templates.

2313
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,820
 And I don't know if you can see

2314
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,070
 that very well, but I've been

2315
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:13,580
 using it.

2316
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,730
 For example, this is this month

2317
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:14,900
.

2318
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,170
 So you can see me tracking my

2319
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,580
 habits on here.

2320
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,320
 And so anyway, those templates

2321
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,730
 are in the back and they're

2322
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:22,880
 also perforated.

2323
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,820
 So you can tear them out and

2324
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,750
 put them on your desk or put

2325
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,080
 them on your kitchen counter or

2326
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,120
 your refrigerator or whatever.

2327
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,530
 And then and then at the very

2328
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,190
 beginning of the book, there is

2329
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:32,600
 a section called one line

2330
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,120
 per day.

2331
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,610
 So I've been using it for what

2332
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:36,680
 happened today.

2333
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,360
 And so I've been writing down

2334
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,920
 what happened each day.

2335
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,520
 And there are 31 lines.

2336
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,000
 So one for each day of the

2337
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,640
 month.

2338
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,880
 And there are 12 of them.

2339
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,890
 So by the time you get to the

2340
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:47,060
 end of the year, you should be

2341
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,240
 able to flip through and see

2342
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,450
 if you I'm doing what happened

2343
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,090
 today, Sean Blanc, it does what

2344
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:53,900
's the highlight of the

2345
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,380
 day.

2346
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,800
 Some other ones that I've seen

2347
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,220
 are what am I grateful for?

2348
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,190
 Or you could use it as like a

2349
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,140
 productivity thing.

2350
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,530
 You could say like, what's my

2351
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,980
 most important task today?

2352
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,980
 Things like that.

2353
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,270
 So there are a lot of examples

2354
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,620
 in the back of the notebook who

2355
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,900
 I have like 16 pages of

2356
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,700
 examples of how to use it.

2357
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,310
 But anyway, it's called the

2358
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,420
 habit journal.

2359
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,180
 And yeah, I'm excited about it.

2360
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,410
 I think it'll be a good tool to

2361
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,990
 help people build better habits

2362
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:17,060
.

2363
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,380
 And a lot of folks, I've heard

2364
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,700
 from a lot of folks that really

2365
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,840
 like the audiobook.

2366
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,610
 So if you folks aren't readers,

2367
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:24,320
 go check out the audiobook.

2368
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,100
 People like us read atomic

2369
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,680
 habits.

2370
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,740
 So thanks again for your time,

2371
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,120
 James.

2372
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,360
 Really appreciate it, man.

2373
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,360
 Awesome.

2374
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:44,600

2375

2376
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,700
 That was helpful for you.

2377
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,230

01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,900
 about is also available there.
