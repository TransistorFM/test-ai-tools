 This is Transistor.fm.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.760
 Hey, product people.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.620
 Justin Jackson here, and I've

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.530
 got a brand new interview for

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.440
 you with James Clear, who

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.520
 is the author of Atomic Habits,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 a book that has really changed

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.400
 my life since I've read

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
 it.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.030
 And I don't want to give too

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.280
 much of an intro.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.260
 I just want to get right into

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.800
 the actual interview.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.210
 If you like this, please reach

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.850
 out to James on Twitter @JamesC

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.320
lear.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.610
 And if you have comments about

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.930
 the episode, reach out to me on

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.560
 Twitter.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.010
 I'm the letter M, the letter I,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.160
 Justin, M, I, Justin.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.680
 Here is me and James talking

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.180
 about habits and how you can

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.440
 make your life better one

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:09.080
 day at a time.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.180
 The book, your book's been out

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.760
 for a while.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.800
 It's right here, Atomic Habits.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.360
 If you see it in an airport or

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.610
 something near you, how long

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.560
 has it been out now?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.840
 Today is 100 days exactly.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 No way.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.540
 Yeah, so just over three months

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.640
.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 I'm curious, because now it's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.560
 been out for a while.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.860
 Is there one idea that you see

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.530
 that people keep sharing, like

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.440
 one idea that resonated

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.300
 from the book in particular

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.120
 that gets shared more than

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.180
 anything else on Twitter or

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.920
 whatever?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.400
 So I was curious about that

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.020
 myself when I was writing the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.840
 book and thinking about it,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.690
 because I kind of felt like,

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.500
 all right, hopefully all these

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.800
 ideas are useful.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.730
 What's the one thing that

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.770
 people are going to latch on to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.960
?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.520
 Because sometimes you'll hear

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.740
 that from authors that there

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.160
 was one chapter or something

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.440
 that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.740
 was the chapter that really

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.600
 stuck with people.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 I'm grateful for the fact that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.350
 there are a variety of things,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.680
 but there are a few things.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.750
 So the first one is identity-

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.310
based habits, which is chapter

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.680
 two.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.510
 And that concept really seems

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.520
 to have resonated with people,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.460
 the idea of trying to reinforce

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.750
 your desired identity and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.190
 starting with who you want to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.550
 become rather than what you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.840
 want

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.560
 to achieve.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.200
 And I'm glad that it did,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170
 because that was the chapter I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.240
 debated over the most of where

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.640
 to put it in the book.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.920
 At different points, it was the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.720
 first chapter.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.200
 It was the last chapter.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.280
 It ended up being the second

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.600
 one.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.110
 I also had this thought in my

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.620
 head that it should be about

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.240
 midway through the book.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.700
 So it really jumped all over

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.050
 the place, but I ended up

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.720
 thinking, I feel like this is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.880
 one

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.180
 of the best ideas, so I want to

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.490
 have it early so that people,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.760
 even if they don't finish

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.300
 the book, they still come

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.520
 across this idea.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.130
 And I'm glad that that ended up

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.960
 working out well.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.950
 The other one that people bring

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.740
 up a lot is the two-minute rule

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.280
 and the idea of scaling

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.820
 your habits down to the point

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.430
 where they take two minutes or

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.920
 less.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.400
 I think that that's a very

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.600
 actionable one.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.820
 It's like, OK, I know exactly

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.360
 what to do.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.800
 I wanted to do a workout, but

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.180
 now I'll just focus on doing

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.160
 five push-ups.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.880
 Or I wanted to read 30 books

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.540
 this year, and now I'll focus

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.080
 on reading one page a day or

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080
 something like that.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.080
 Got you.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.830
 So I think the actionableness

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.740
 of that one also tends to stick

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.840
.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.130
 And so going back to the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.260
 identity one, is this the idea

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.280
 that every action you take or

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.900
 every habit you develop is a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.640
 vote for the person you want to

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.320
 become?

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.320
 Right.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.200
 So that's kind of like my core

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.890
 philosophy behind it, this idea

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.680
 that the way that we develop

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.730
 beliefs about ourselves, that

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.700
 we reinforce our self-image,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.600
 that we develop our identity

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.660
 to a certain degree, is largely

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.680
 reinforced by the experiences

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.600
 and behaviors that we perform

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 over time.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.690
 So some aspects of your

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.290
 identity are relatively fixed,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.780
 like, for example, if you're

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.680
 tall or

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680
 short.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.520
 Even that idea that I am tall

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.960
 or I am short, that's

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.040
 reinforced.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.650
 You learn that through

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.400
 experiences in life.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.140
 Now there are many aspects of

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.810
 your identity that are less

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.760
 fixed than that, but are still

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.000
 reinforced by your experiences.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.550
 So if you write one sentence

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.660
 today, you probably don't think

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.450
 about yourself as I am a writer

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.880
.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.350
 But if you do that every day

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.950
 for six months or nine months

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.600
 or a year, at some point you

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.950
 turn around and you think, "Huh

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.200
, maybe I am the kind of person

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.040
 who is a writer."

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.280
 Or if you study biology every

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.080
 Tuesday night for 20 minutes,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.320
 you at some point think, "I

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320
 guess I'm studious.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.000
 I keep doing this every week.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.040
 Maybe this is the kind of

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.760
 person I am."

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.570
 And so I like that idea that

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.560
 our habits are like votes for

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.640
 the type of person we believe

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.630
 that we are, that they build up

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.090
 evidence of looking at

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.080
 ourselves in a certain way.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.840
 And I like to phrase it that

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.840
 way not only because I believe

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.560
 that it's true, but also

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.440
 beliefs and behavior are kind

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.920
 of a two-way street.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.650
 So you'll hear people say

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.870
 things like, "Just be positive

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.040
 or just believe in yourself or

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.720
 fake it till you make it," or

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.920
 things like that.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.060
 And there's nothing necessarily

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.660
 wrong with fake it till you

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.400
 make it.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.790
 It's fine to be positive and

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.500
 believe things about yourself,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.920
 but it's a very short-term

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.840
 strategy because fake it till

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.290
 you make it is asking you to

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.880
 believe something about

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.520
 yourself

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.480
 without having evidence for it.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.860
 It's like that kind of

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.920
 visualization stuff or mantra

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.970
 stuff where you look at

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.480
 yourself

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.250
 in the mirror and you tell

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.200
 yourself, "I am a writer.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.120
 I am a writer," even though you

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.700
 haven't written yet.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.040
 And so what I'm saying is

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.290
 similar, but I think

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.020
 importantly different in the

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.360
 sense that you

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.040
 let the behavior lead the way

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.640
 rather than the belief.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.110
 And I think that's the best

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.850
 lever we have for changing the

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.680
 way that we look at ourselves,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.060
 which is to say, show up and

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.670
 write a sentence every day, and

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.000
 soon you're going to have

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.320
 something

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.440
 to root that new identity of, "

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.800
I am a writer in."

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.140
 And it's a much more, I think,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.340
 robust and long-term way of

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.480
 changing how you look at

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 yourself.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.000
 Yeah, I think for me the...

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.110
 Because you first communicated

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.550
 that idea to me in an airport

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.840
 in Denver.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.160
 Yeah, I remember that.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.560
 And at the time in my life, I

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.720
 was not doing so good.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.920
 I was depressed.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.920
 I was, I think, cynical.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.710
 Especially, I think cynical

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.980
 about people like you that seem

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.520
 to have it all together, that

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.160
 seem to be really like doing

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.360
 all the good habits.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.250
 And when you're not doing so

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.740
 good, looking at someone that

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.360
 seems to have it all together

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.630
 just can make you more grumpy

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.370
 or more cynical or more

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.520
 whatever.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.860
 But I remember you sitting down

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.930
 and kind of hashing this out

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.800
 with me.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.450
 And that idea of, "Justin, no

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.910
 matter where you're at right

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.480
 now and no matter what you've

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.740
 done, you could start today

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.080
 with one action."

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.520
 So if you go running today,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.830
 that might not make a big

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.120
 difference.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.870
 And then if you do it tomorrow

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.220
 and then the next day and then

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.640
 the next day and then the

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.870
 next day, at the end of the

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.440
 week, you might say, "Well,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.880
 wait a second.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.120
 I think I'm a runner."

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.050
 And maybe after a couple of

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.210
 weeks, you might say, "Well, I

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.240
'm going to get myself some

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.520
 runner

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.770
 clothes and go and get some

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.720
 runner clothes.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.520
 And then I'm going to get

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.640
 myself a good pair of...

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.750
 Shoot, I'm going to install

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.320
 that Strava app."

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.330
 And all of a sudden you could

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.000
 see yourself.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.950
 That was a really hopeful

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.900
 message for me when I was

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.310
 really struggling to figure out

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:57.680
.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.440
 It was way easier for me to be

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.280
 cynical and just kind of look

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.880
 back at all these people

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.410
 implementing good, healthy

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.110
 processes and say, "Well, that

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.000
's not for me.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.650
 That's just for people that

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.560
 whatever."

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.230
 But seeing, hearing that gave

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.660
 me hope to think, "I could do

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.480
 that.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.030
 And it's surprising how little

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.030
 time it takes to accomplish

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.200
 that.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.120
 Is that something...

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.110
 Have other people been kind of

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.440
 referencing that too?

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.200
 Is that part of the...

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.420
 And maybe that's what's so good

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.610
 about having it as chapter two

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.680
 because it gives me some

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.680
 hope, right?

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.680
 Right, yeah.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.980
 Well, what's interesting is

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.290
 that that process of changing

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.640
 in that way, it's happening

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.200
 anyway.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.530
 If you think back to the

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.350
 beginning, for example, if I

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:45.960
 think of the early days of my

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.080
 entrepreneurial

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.820
 career, well, I didn't have any

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.520
 entrepreneurs in my family.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.840
 I didn't have any close friends

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.080
 who were entrepreneurs.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.560
 There was no reason for me to

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.820
 think that's who I am or to

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.340
 feel like I was externally

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.640
 validated with that was part of

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.320
 my identity.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.400
 I had no evidence of it.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.140
 And so early on, all I had was

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.240
 hope, right?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.430
 The hope that, "Oh, maybe I'll

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.600
 be able to build something.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.210
 Maybe I'll be able to make this

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.760
 work."

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.260
 But then you start to show up,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.640
 and for me, it was probably

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.760
 about two years in.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.300
 It's probably about where I

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.090
 kind of like the scale tipped,

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.840
 and I started to think, "I am

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840
 an entrepreneur.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.600
 That's part of who I am."

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.930
 But it really took proving it

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.680
 to myself that I can pay my

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.120
 bills through this, that I can

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.890
 like actually have a lifestyle

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.440
 and a career in this way.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.930
 I had to prove it for about two

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.500
 years before I really started

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.880
 to latch onto it and say,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.560
 "This is who I am."

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.370
 And so my point is, that's

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.120
 always happening.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.900
 You're continually updating

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.610
 your beliefs about yourself

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.480
 based on the experiences that

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:47.600
 you're

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600
 going through.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.250
 And all I'm talking about is

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.120
 simply designing that process

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.800
 in a little more careful or

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.320
 thoughtful

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.700
 way rather than just kind of

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.200
 letting it happen to you and be

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.490
 like, "Well, I guess I'll

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:58.720
 figure

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.460
 out who I am based on what life

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.280
 throws at me versus how about I

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.760
 figure out who I am based

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.420
 on the votes that I cast each

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.240
 day and what habits I decide to

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.040
 follow?"

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.830
 Again, that is a very hopeful

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.780
 message for someone who's just

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.200
 kind of sitting back and

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.960
 waiting for it to happen.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.820
 What sustains you when you're

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.360
 in the process but not there

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360
 yet?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.190
 Like you mentioned entrepreneur

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.820
 and you're like, "Man, it took

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.760
 a long time."

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760
 What sustains you?

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.230
 Good question because I think a

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.880
 lot of habits, entrepreneurship

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.560
 is certainly this way, exercise

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.230
 is this way where the rewards

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.330
 of a habit are often very

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.880
 delayed.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.670
 What's the reward for working

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.880
 out for three weeks?

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.820
 Not really a whole lot,

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.400
 honestly.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.820
 Your body hasn't really changed

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.000
.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.320
 The scale is probably about the

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.880
 same.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.960
 You're probably just sore.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.530
 There probably isn't a whole

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.680
 lot to show for it.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.950
 It's really not unless you

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.390
 stick with that habit for three

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.600
 months or six months or a

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.620
 year that you actually start to

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.640
 see the changes you were hoping

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.400
 to get when you set out.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.630
 There's this valley of death in

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.780
 the beginning where in a way it

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.760
 gets harder before it gets

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.760
 easier.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.960
 It feels uncomfortable.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.880
 You feel sore and pain.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.250
 You feel uncertain when you

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.160
 walk in the gym.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.440
 You feel like people are

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.080
 judging you.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.190
 Same way with starting a

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.840
 business.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.040
 In a weird way, it's harder

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.240
 before it gets easier.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.570
 You start out, but you're not

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.520
 making any money.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.850
 You feel stupid a lot of the

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.420
 time because you don't know how

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.600
 to make a sales call or

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.360
 what customers are looking for

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.180
 or whether you're even offering

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.480
 the right product.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.240
 I remember when I first started

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.830
, like I said, I didn't know

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.640
 anybody.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.840
 Didn't have any entrepreneurs

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.480
 in my family.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.550
 I was like, "Well, I need to

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.680
 get to know some people."

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.910
 I sent a bunch of emails to

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.130
 reach out and just ask if

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.640
 people would chat on Skype for

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.720
 like 30 minutes or whatever.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.220
 I remember sending those first

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.650
 few and thinking, "Do people

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.480
 even do this?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.600
 Do people chat on Skype with

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.710
 people that they haven't met

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:58.200
 before?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.000
 Is this a weird thing to ask?"

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.890
 There's just a lot of that

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.800
 uncertainty early on.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.020
 Your point is, I think, a valid

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.240
 one, which is, "Well, what do

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.240
 you do to get through that?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.570
 How do you get through that

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.880
 valley of death while you're

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.140
 waiting for the long-term

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:12.680
 rewards

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680
 to accumulate?"

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.650
 I think that this is where

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.430
 psychologists call it

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.790
 reinforcement or an external

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.040
 reinforcer,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.510
 that you want some kind of

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.490
 reinforcement that is enjoyable

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.240
 in the moment so that you have

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.720
 a reason to keep showing up.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.220
 There are from a habit

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.470
 standpoint, there are two ways

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.440
 to do this.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.420
 First thing is just a strategic

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.410
 choice about what type of habit

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.040
 you choose to follow.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.470
 If we go back to the exercise

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.180
 example, well, not everybody

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.640
 has to work out like a body

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.640
 builder.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.190
 You could do Pilates or yoga or

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.540
 go for a run or rock climbing

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.280
 or all kinds of stuff.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.000
 Pick the form of a habit that

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.860
 brings you the most joy, that

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.680
 is most enjoyable to you.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.970
 It's going to be a slog for,

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.280
 you're going to have to swim

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.600
 for months to see a change

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600
 in your body.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.230
 You're going to have to cycle

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.600
 for months.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.450
 You're going to have to lift

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.200
 weights for months.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.210
 It doesn't really matter which

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:06.840
 one you choose.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.560
 It's going to take a while.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.270
 You might as well choose the

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.990
 one that's most exciting or

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.320
 enjoyable to you.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.990
 Same way with like, imagine a

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.080
 reading habit.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.080
 You don't have to read.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.220
 You might feel like, "Oh, I

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.340
 have a business, so I need to

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.520
 read business books."

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.780
 But really ultimately, the most

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.920
 important thing is do you get

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.960
 in the habit of reading?

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.610
 Do you fall in love with

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.520
 reading?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.070
 If you need to start with sci-

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.840
fi books or fantasy or something

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.280
 like that, well, start

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.280
 with that.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.990
 Do the one that is intrins

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.440
ically valuable to you at first.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.230
 Once the habit is built, then

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.940
 you can transition to some of

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.160
 the other stuff.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.660
 That's one method for getting

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.320
 through that valley of death.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320
 Yeah.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.870
 I think this brings up maybe a

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.450
 harder question, which is, so

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.310
 based on your book, it's

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.160
 January

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.780
 and I'm thinking, "Okay, I

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.260
 haven't been in the gym for

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.280
 seven years.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.560
 I used to love working out.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.240
 I'm going to go.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.160
 I got my streaks app on my

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.000
 phone.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.160
 Start going."

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.210
 I've probably been, I don't

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.260
 know, I've probably been at

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.800
 least 18 days or maybe even 20

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.000
 days

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 this month.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.120
 It's great.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.620
 I was surprised by how fast I

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.320
 felt.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.390
 The first day, I felt like I

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.160
 didn't belong.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160
 I felt awkward.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.130
 I don't know anybody here I'm

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.160
 walking in.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.570
 Some of the machinery, I

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:30.440
 recognize.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440
 Some I don't.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.720
 I have to get back into a

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.960
 routine.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960
 I have to find which exercise I

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.120
'm going to do.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.010
 There's all these insecurities

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.680
 and questions.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.990
 But after a week, I felt like I

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.520
 belonged.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.630
 But I wonder if that's because

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.040
 it was easier for me.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.380
 I had this, I'm relatively, I

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.160
 was already relatively in shape

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:00.320
.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.600
 There's a big difference

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.010
 between going in where you feel

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.400
 like, "Oh, maybe I'm a few

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400
 pounds overweight."

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.290
 Going in and being 200 pounds

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.160
 overweight.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.410
 There's a big difference

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.730
 between going in even as a

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.760
 white male compared to, there's

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.100
 a big difference going in and

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.630
 feeling like, "Well, I've done

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.040
 these exercises before so

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.850
 I'm not completely out of my

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.880
 element."

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.770
 And I'm wondering how, I mean,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.160
 are habits like that achievable

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.520
 because of privilege

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.160
 and context and other things.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.340
 How much does that play into it

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:36.640
?

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.990
 And if someone is walking in

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.570
 and they're 200 pounds

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.440
 overweight, do they still have

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.520
 the

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.700
 same chance of progress and

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.680
 success?

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.520
 It just feels like such a big

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.560
 mountain for them to go over.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.720
 For sure.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720
 Yeah.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.330
 So, this is one reason why I

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.870
 think starting with small

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.270
 habits is so incredibly

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:58.960
 important

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.410
 because a lot of the time when

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.000
 we think about the outcome that

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.640
 you want, so just to continue

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.080
 your weight loss or exercise

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.820
 example, everybody gets wrapped

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.240
 up and like, "Oh, I want to

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.440
 lose

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.590
 100 pounds or I want to lose 20

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.160
 pounds or whatever the number

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:12.640
 is."

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.160
 But you forget about there,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.490
 like all these little log

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.130
istical and emotional details

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:17.440
 that

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.620
 come along with starting a new

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.360
 habit.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.620
 So I'll often tell the story

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.100
 about, I have this reader who,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.720
 he ended up losing over 100

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720
 pounds.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.850
 And one of the first things he

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.010
 did was he went to the gym, but

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.000
 he wasn't allowed to

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.260
 stay for longer than five

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.880
 minutes.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.610
 So he drove to the gym, got out

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.780
 of the car, did half an

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.720
 exercise, got back in the car,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.880
 drove home.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.190
 And it sounds ridiculous to

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:38.760
 people.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.020
 It sounds silly because it's

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.600
 like, "Well, clearly exercising

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.720
 for five minutes is not

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.720
 going to get you in shape."

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.720
 I guess not.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.560
 But what you realize is he was

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.620
 mastering the art of showing up

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:48.840
.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.380
 He was becoming the type of

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.990
 person that drove to the gym

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.800
 every day.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.500
 And when you're in that state,

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.130
 for him at that point, that was

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.520
 the biggest shift was,

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.150
 "Can I just become the type of

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.770
 person who gets in here, who

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.480
 overcomes the uncertainty

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.290
 or feeling uncomfortable or

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.600
 feeling judged?"

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.620
 And all those things are very

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.490
 real hurdles to building a

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.240
 habit.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.090
 There are all these little

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.920
 questions that need to be

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.860
 answered for something like

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.360
 that.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.940
 Like, "Okay, I want to go to

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.640
 the gym.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.960
 Well, what time am I going to

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.280
 go?

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.770
 Am I going to go before work or

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:19.600
 after work?

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.120
 What gym will I go to?

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.420
 What route am I going to take

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.160
 to get there?

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.560
 Do I need to bring a water

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.310
 bottle or is there like a water

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.760
 fountain at the gym?"

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.590
 And all those little questions

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.410
 like that, like whether or not

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.960
 there's a water fountain

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.840
 at the gym, it sounds small.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.860
 But if you already feel

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.310
 uncomfortable and feel like you

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.520
 don't belong and then you

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:38.800
 always

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.560
 forget to bring your water

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.450
 bottle and you're like, "Oh,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.430
 there's nothing ever, and there

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.560
's

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.880
 never anything to drink there."

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.290
 That's enough friction to get

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.760
 you to quit in the beginning.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.020
 So starting with something

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.550
 simple, like, "All I'm going to

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.120
 do is I'm going to show up and

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.790
 I'm going to do one exercise

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.540
 for five minutes and then I'm

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.600
 going to go."

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.950
 That I think is a good way to

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:56.480
 start.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.880
 And it reminds me of what

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.600
 Steven Pressfield wrote.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.570
 I think it was in the War of

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.760
 Art where he said something to

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.840
 the effect of like, "If

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.310
 you sit down each day at the

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.650
 computer and you do your

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.260
 writing, at some point, at

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:07.720
 first

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.240
 it feels uncomfortable, but at

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.610
 some point that becomes your

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.400
 territory."

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.730
 And I really like that phrasing

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.890
 of it because for an animal,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.920
 for a wolf or something, a

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.610
 piece of land does not become

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.310
 their territory unless they

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.000
 spend time in it, right?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.920
 Unless they are there each day.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.340
 It has to become comfortable

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:26.840
 first.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.420
 And so for many people building

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.130
 habits, whether that's getting

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.440
 into the gym or going to the

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.940
 yoga studio or sitting your

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.630
 butt in the chair and writing,

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.060
 you need to make that space

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.400
 your

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400
 territory.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.350
 And the very first step is not

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.800
 getting a result.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.440
 It's spending time there.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.120
 It's making that little bit of

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.800
 land a zone where you feel like

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.360
, "This is where I belong

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360
 each day."

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.180
 And that's a big emotional

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.340
 hurdle to cross before you even

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.600
 worry about any of the physical

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.480
 or actual technical things to

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:56.880
 do.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.880
 Yeah.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.070
 And I mean, the other thing

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.480
 that helped is I went with my

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.360
 wife and it's funny because

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.650
 I felt like I'm like Mr. Conf

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.140
ident, but she was like, at one

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.600
 point, she's like, "Justin,

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.840
 you are so nervous right now."

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.000
 She could tell how nervous I

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.600
 was.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.560
 But I thought I was keeping it

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.760
 all together.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.850
 And it just reminded me of, I'd

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.700
 been to gyms from the time I

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.240
 was in grade nine all the

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.680
 way through college.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.070
 It wasn't like it was

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.690
 unfamiliar, but I was nervous

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.400
 because it was unfamiliar.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.480
 There had been a seven-year gap

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.320
 and now I was exploring this

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.240
 again, worried about what

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.900
 these people are thinking about

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.240
 me.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.200
 "Wow, that guy looks like he's

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.800
 way more fit than me."

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.430
 All these thoughts go through

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.360
 your head.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.110
 And so, yeah, I think kind of

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.870
 figuring out how you can make a

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.240
 step and sometimes maybe

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.110
 it's like going with somebody

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.910
 so you at least have some

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.270
 emotional, because it's

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.240
 emotional.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.860
 It's nice to have someone to

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.490
 kind of share the emotional

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.720
 burden, right?

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720
 For sure.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.520
 Well, if you come, the thing

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.270
 that ultimately what you're

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.160
 looking to do is, like we just

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.460
 said, feel like it's part of

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.360
 your territory.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.570
 And because there are other

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.980
 people in that space, what that

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.320
 also means is you're looking

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.930
 to feel like you're part of the

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.720
 tribe who goes there, right?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.350
 You belong with the other

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.360
 people who are in that room.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.700
 And so it helps to, what is a

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.600
 tribe?

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.720
 Well, it's a group of people

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.900
 that you get along with, that

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.440
 you bond with, that you belong

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.450
 to over something else, over

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.200
 some shared interest.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.420
 And in other words, it's a

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.480
 group in a lot of ways of

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.200
 friends, friends who share some

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200
 kind of interest.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.840
 So these are your gym friends.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.600
 Well, if you go with your wife,

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.320
 then you automatically have at

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.060
 least one person in the tribe

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.360
 that

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.320
 you are friends with, that you

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.520
 do belong with.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.130
 And so I think that helps you

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.020
 get over that hurdle a little

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.320
 bit.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.940
 You're no longer facing that

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.160
 challenge alone.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.980
 Before it was like, I am trying

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.760
 to get fit.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.930
 Now it is we are trying to get

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:02.480
 fit.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.320
 And that helps a lot with the

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.240
 kind of the mental feeling of

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.160
 like, do I belong or not?

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160
 Yeah.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.600
 So I don't mean to stay on this

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.950
 too long, but it's so fresh

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.240
 that the other thing I found

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.030
 myself doing, because I'm

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.910
 interested in the emotional

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.800
 friction behind habits.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.840
 And so the other thing I was

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.120
 doing is I was going in there

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.120
 and I'm uncomfortable.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.880
 So I'm trying to act really

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.520
 tough, but I'm not tough at all

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:32.880
.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.560
 But when people look at me, I'm

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.310
 kind of like scowling when like

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.800
 I'm not being friendly.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.160
 I'm not being myself.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.990
 And I was thinking about that

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.730
 and thinking like when you're

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.240
 kind of inward focused and

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.200
 you're in a new environment and

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.130
 you're trying to develop a new

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.080
 habit, but you're inward

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.240
 focused,

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.210
 it really is, it doesn't really

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.000
 help.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.840
 And so I had to kind of turn

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.920
 that around and go, okay, I got

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.880
 to start being friendly.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.370
 I got to start saying hi to

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.310
 these people, because if I wave

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.000
 at this person and it feels

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.820
 good, like they respond with a

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.840
 smile.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.940
 And that happens again next

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.320
 time.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.620
 And again, next time, that's a

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.920
 little bit of a reward for me.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.050
 That's going to keep me going

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:15.560
 to the gym.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.850
 But if I keep going here with

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.530
 this like tough scowl on my

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.760
 face, and it's hard because you

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.840
 feel like you don't belong.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.280
 You feel nervous.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.320
 And you kind of default to

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.560
 these weird behaviors.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.710
 And it took a little bit of

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.670
 time, but I realized, okay, now

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.040
 I got to get in the habit of

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:39.640
 smiling

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.180
 and saying hello when I'm in

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.920
 the gym, not just being like in

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.520
 my own zone and pretending

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.760
 I'm somebody I'm not, right?

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.090
 Well, that's one thing that

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.260
 kind of helps you start to

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.640
 belong or become part of the

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.280
 rest of the tribe.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.510
 Just a friendly behavior helps

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.310
 you start to develop

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.550
 friendships with some of those

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:55.860
 other

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.860
 people that are there.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.860
 Yeah.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.300
 A study that I wanted to cite

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.040
 in Atomic Habits, but I couldn

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.560
't find it to track it down.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.090
 But I read about it years ago,

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:07.720
 where the YMCA ran a survey.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.490
 And when they surveyed people

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.250
 who were joining the gym, the

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.800
 thing that got them to join

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.200
 were

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.790
 the different classes offered,

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.140
 the equipment that was in the

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.560
 gym, basically facilities

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.110
 and features were the things

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.460
 that got people in for the

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.320
 first time.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.410
 But then when they surveyed

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.590
 members who had been there for

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.840
 over a year, the thing that

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.390
 got people to stick, nobody

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.620
 mentioned features or

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.500
 facilities.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.300
 Everybody mentioned friendships

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:30.500
.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.840
 And so the people who actually

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.200
 stayed at the gym or kept their

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.420
 membership were the ones

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.650
 who ended up developing

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.250
 friendships with other people

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.780
 there.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.780
 And I think you're right.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.140
 Ultimately, the thing that gets

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.220
 you to come back is like, do I

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.180
 enjoy coming here?

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.450
 Does it mean I get to see some

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:44.300
 of my friends?

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.450
 Does it mean I get to hang out

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.380
 with people I like?

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.460
 Or, you know, it's really the

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.750
 sense of belonging that gets

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:51.740
 habits to stick.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.290
 And the action itself is just

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.920
 kind of like something that's

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.480
 happening along the way.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480
 Yes.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.730
 But there's a step before that

00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.980
 that we kind of skipped over,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.120
 which is like, how do you

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.010
 even choose a habit in the

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.200
 first place?

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.200
 Like how does that happen?

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.160
 In the sense of, I might not

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.920
 know what's good for me.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.520
 So how does that come into this

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:15.520
?

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.520
 Yeah.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.420
 Well, there are a lot of ways

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.360
 to answer that question.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.590
 So I'll just share a couple of

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.920
 thoughts that come to mind.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.490
 So the first thought that comes

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.070
 to mind is this question from,

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.300
 I first heard from Seth

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.920
 Godin, which I think is just a

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.750
 great question, which is, what

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.460
 is it for?

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.520
 And so this is a question that

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.610
 we need to ask ourselves when

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.540
 we're trying to build a

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.080
 new habit, which is, what is

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.100
 this habit for?

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.770
 What am I actually trying to

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:37.860
 achieve here?

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.490
 Because the correct habit to

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.250
 choose is very different based

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.940
 on what your goals are, what

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.710
 you're hoping to get as an

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.090
 outcome, what kind of lifestyle

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.020
 you want.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.830
 And so for example, the habit

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.160
 of making 20 sales calls a day.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.680
 Well, if what it's for is to

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.430
 increase revenue and to build a

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.280
 successful business, that's

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.880
 a wonderful thing.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.490
 If you hate making sales calls

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.100
 and you want to spend less time

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.440
 working and more time with

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.700
 your family, that could be a

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.000
 terrible habit to build.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.410
 It just depends on what it's

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.080
 for.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.430
 So that's one question to ask,

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.400
 but you are correct that we

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.800
 often don't know what we need

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.440
 in the moment.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.420
 And I think part of that is

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.600
 just a challenge of life and a

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.900
 challenge of self-awareness

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.650
 and knowing what you need, but

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.460
 life is a very complex system.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.030
 And so figuring out the right

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.350
 thing for that is sometimes

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.780
 just impossible or too many

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.260
 moving

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.260
 parts.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.820
 So I tend to default to two

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.100
 possible answers.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.480
 The first answer is, we all

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.980
 need things that are so boring

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.900
 that we don't think about them,

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.150
 but are incredibly important

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.260
 for showing up each day.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.860
 So did you sleep eight hours?

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.320
 Are you drinking enough water?

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.700
 Are you spending a little bit

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.970
 of time walking outside or

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.350
 getting a little bit of

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.840
 sunlight?

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.640
 Do you exercise consistently?

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.580
 Whatever form is interesting to

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.040
 you?

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.210
 Are you spending some time

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.390
 reading and soaking up new

00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.880
 ideas?

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.330
 I'm not saying you have to do

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:02.890
 all that stuff every day, but

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.480
 my point is those are things

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.920
 that most people would be like,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.260
 "Yeah, of course, you should

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.480
 sleep and read more books

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480
 and exercise.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.680
 Everybody knows that's good."

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.400
 But your time is almost never

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.100
 going to be wasted by making

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.790
 sure you do one of those things

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.840
.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.310
 It's a fundamental that's worth

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.680
 spending time on that's worth

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.020
 coming back to, that's worth

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.900
 reminding yourself of, even if

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.360
 you aren't sure the ideal

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.940
 perfect place to focus in your

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.940
 life.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.540
 So that's the first answer.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.220
 Come back to the fundamentals.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.310
 The second answer is more broad

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.700
.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.030
 I can't be specific with it

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.370
 because it depends on each

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:37.510
 person, but the broad

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.260
 application

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.190
 is what I would call broad

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.060
 funnel tight filter.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.700
 So whenever you're trying to

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.460
 figure out where to focus, you

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.160
 need a really broad range of

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.090
 research, try to get as many

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.370
 options as possible, then apply

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.560
 a really tight strict filter to

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.300
 it and just focus on the one or

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.210
 two best options that you found

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:57.520
.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.790
 So for example, I just finished

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.860
 Atomic Habits a few months ago,

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.520
 so now I'm thinking, "Should

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.760
 I write a second book?

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.510
 If I should, what should that

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.320
 be about?"

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.790
 And I don't know right now, so

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.440
 I'm in the broad funnel stage.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.600
 So I want to lay out as many

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.780
 options as possible.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.170
 I want to brainstorm a thousand

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:14.700
 titles.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.110
 I want to look at all the top

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.220
 books on Amazon.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.260
 I want to browse my best

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.580
 performing tweets and see if

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.060
 there's a possible thread for a

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.060
 book idea in there.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.530
 I want to look everywhere I can

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:24.990
 and just list all of that stuff

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.380
 in the same spreadsheet.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.560
 And maybe I got 1200 ideas on

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.540
 there, really broad funnel.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.510
 But then I need to apply a very

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.740
 tight filter.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.590
 Is this something I'm

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.790
 interested in enough to spend

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.780
 two or three or four years

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.260
 working

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.260
 on?

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.640
 Is it a topic of broad appeal

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.960
 to a general audience?

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.360
 Are there going to be a lot of

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.720
 people that like this?

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.590
 Is this something that I can

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.450
 actually turn into something

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:48.480
 actionable?

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.960
 Can people use this in their

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.760
 daily life?

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.460
 Is this a topic that has a lot

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.480
 of stories that I could tell?

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.620
 Can I actually make this

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.930
 entertaining or latch on to

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.370
 other interesting stories to

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:58.760
 make the

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760
 book readable?

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.760
 Yes.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.890
 And those are just some of the

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.400
 filters.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.240
 But my point is that you want

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.550
 some period of very broad

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.560
 exploration, and then once you

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.030
 have a lot of options, you want

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.510
 to really tighten it down based

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.740
 on that question, what

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.740
 is this for?

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.420
 So in my case, the question I'm

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.090
 using is, well, it's for

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.420
 writing a good book, one that's

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.740
 highly actionable, one that

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.100
 sells a lot of copies, one that

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.420
 people find useful, and so

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.420
 on.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.860
 And so I think if you combine

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.440
 that broad funnel type filter

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.100
 strategy and that question of

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.740
 what is it for, that can maybe

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.250
 give you some more specific

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:30.980
 answers.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.280
 But even if you don't come up

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.830
 with something good there, you

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.910
 can always focus on the

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.860
 fundamentals.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.940
 And the other thing, when you

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.040
 mentioned Seth Godin, he has

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.820
 this other line, which is

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.440
 people

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.320
 like us do things like this.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.320
 I love that line.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.020
 I wish I had thought it up, but

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.320
 yeah, it's so good.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.480
 It's such a great mantra.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.580
 And what's interesting about it

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.950
 is, like for me, one thing that

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.720
 made me start thinking

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.780
 about healthy habits was

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.420
 hanging out with people who had

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.060
 healthy habits.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.730
 And in some ways, it was really

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.900
 lucky and fortunate, like you

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.200
 guys invited me to that

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.020
 retreat you did.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.670
 And in some ways, I'm thankful

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.210
 you guys invited a loser like

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.900
 me, because I was hanging out

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.100
 in that group.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.120
 I came and at first I was

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.240
 cynical and grumpy.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.810
 And eventually, just looking

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.300
 around that group, I realized,

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.340
 man, these people like this do

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.960
 things like this.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.550
 And my cynicism, which before

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:41.930
 it would have been like, wow,

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.440
 people like that do stuff like

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.160
 that.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.520
 It went down.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.140
 And then all of a sudden I was

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.130
 like, okay, well, if people

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.040
 like this do things like this,

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.240
 that's what I need to do.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.300
 And I think for folks that are

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.710
 thinking like, okay, well, how

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.580
 do I know what good habits

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.580
 are?

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.970
 There are so many things that I

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:08.690
 would have never been, what do

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.220
 you call it?

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.040
 There's the stages of habits or

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:12.860
 whatever.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.500
 But I would have never even had

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.850
 the cue if I had not first

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.500
 observed it and then noticed

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.590
 like, oh wait, they're doing

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.940
 that.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.940
 They're doing that.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.940
 They're doing that.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.100
 I'm the odd man out.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.620
 And that's what motivated me to

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.760
 want to pursue some of that

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.600
 stuff.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.840
 But if I hadn't been in that

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.150
 group and felt like, wait a

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.450
 second, like, if I want to

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.960
 belong

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.680
 here, I've got to up my game,

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.920
 right?

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.640
 It would have never happened.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.550
 And so people like us do things

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.170
 like this has been really

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.400
 helpful for me.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.360
 Yeah, I love that phrase.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.380
 And one of the reasons I said

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.540
 that, oh, I wish I had thought

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.720
 that up, is because I think

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.610
 it applies so deeply to a lot

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.900
 of the ideas in Atomic Habits.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.490
 It applies to how socially

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.060
 reinforced our habits are.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.130
 I think this is, you know, I

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.380
 wrote about this in the book.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.550
 I mean, I have a whole chapter

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:02.940
 on it.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.820
 Chapter nine is all about that.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.250
 But I think I still undersold

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.430
 the importance of how socially

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.540
 reinforced our habits are.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.540
 And then it also references the

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.900
 importance of a shared identity

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:15.900
.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.310
 I think that ultimately a

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.000
 shared identity is really one

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.760
 of the most powerful forces for

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.280
 getting habits to stick.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.220
 You know, like if you look at,

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.000
 if you look at it in a big way,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.240
 you can look at like religions,

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.120
 you know, people, religions are

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.750
 really interesting places to

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.840
 look for habits.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.600
 People get in the habit of

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.680
 going to church every Sunday

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.200
 for 50 years, largely because

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.520
 it's reinforced.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.870
 The other people in their

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.670
 neighborhoods go, the people on

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.400
 their block go, they see their

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.400
 friends there.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.630
 They, it's a very socially

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.460
 reinforced habit.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.150
 Same thing is true in smaller

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.680
 ways.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.940
 Like let's say you move into a

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.280
 new house and you walk outside

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.460
 on Tuesday night and you

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.110
 see all your neighbors have

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.900
 their recycling bins out.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.310
 And you're like, huh, people

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.780
 like us do things like this.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.870
 Like people who live in this

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.230
 neighborhood recycle on Tuesday

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.740
 nights.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.280
 I guess we need to sign up for

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.180
 recycling.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.830
 And there are really almost an

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.620
 infinite range of examples that

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.140
 are like that, both large

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.200
 and small, where our habits are

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.040
, we notice them because the

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.800
 people around us are doing

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.210
 them, which is what the Q

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.000
 portion is you referenced.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.920
 We desire to do them.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.810
 We crave to follow through on

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.920
 them because by doing the same,

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.360
 we fit in or signal to

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.840
 the other people around us, Hey

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.440
, I get it.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.000
 I'm part of the tribe too.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.260
 It becomes easier to do it

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.640
 because sometimes you have

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.140
 friends helping you out, you

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:38.520
 know,

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.220
 like it's like having a spotter

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.000
 at the gym.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.830
 Like, Oh, people like us to

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.770
 help each other out when a set

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:45.420
 is hard.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.310
 And then ultimately it becomes

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.130
 satisfying because you enjoy

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:50.660
 being praised for it.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.990
 You know, other people are like

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:53.050
, Hey, it was great to see you

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.380
 at church on Sunday or, you

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.540
 know, really good job on that

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.380
 workout today.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.180
 And that feels good to be

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.220
 praised for fitting in.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.760
 And so in that way, socially

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.140
 reinforced habits or the

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.730
 collective identity, it hits

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.540
 all four

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.840
 stages of habit formation.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.370
 And I knew that when I was

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.370
 writing it, but I don't think I

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.240
 gave it as much importance

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.400
 as I should have.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.560
 It's a very powerful driver of

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.720
 behavior in the long run.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.720
 Yeah, totally.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.380
 And I think this is why cyn

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.360
icism is such a toxic attitude.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.850
 And you know, I'm, I guess I'm

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:34.800
 in Gen X.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.040
 I'm born in 1980.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.010
 There's a lot of cynicism in

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:39.620
 Gen X.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.450
 And then millennials also have

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:43.060
 a little bit of this too.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.720
 And I think, and actually to be

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.380
 honest, everybody has it.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.720
 Baby boomers have it when, you

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.170
 know, if you're a 50 year old

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.620
 programmer and you're, you get

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.510
 hired at a startup where the

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:57.450
 CEO is 20 years old, we kind of

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:59.740
 default to cynicism.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.900
 And it, it, it's such a blocker

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.130
 when you're like trying to

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.780
 observe those norms like, Oh

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.500
 wait, like people like us do

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.760
 things like this.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.510
 Cynicism allows you to go, well

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:11.840
, yeah, people like that do

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.920
 stuff like that.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.920
 That's good for them.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.800
 That's good for James Clear.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.290
 But you know, that's not good

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:19.120
 for me.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.660
 And when I'm trying to kind of

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.350
 reveal from my experience for

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.680
 anyone that ever watches

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.810
 this or listens to this is that

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:30.610
 you really do need to step

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.520
 outside that and at least

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.390
 be open to this idea that your

00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:37.700
 life could get better.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.470
 And it could just be going,

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:41.670
 okay, well, I'm going to, I'm

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.380
 going to vote for who I'm going

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.500
 to be today and I'm going to

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.610
 vote for who I'm going to be

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:46.780
 tomorrow and I'm going to

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.060
 keep going.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.210
 The other thing in the book

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.560
 that really helped me and I'll

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.680
 probably butcher it so you

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.020
 clean

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.540
 up after I do it, but you show

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.660
 this grid.

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.210
 So imagine like on this side of

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.800
 your day, it's like, okay, I

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.140
 make a good decision.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.700
 So it goes up.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.620
 And then I make another good

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.080
 decision.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.080
 It goes up.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.440
 But then I make a bad decision.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.710
 Like I eat a tub of ice cream

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.500
 and you know, sometimes eating

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.880
 the tub of ice cream is like

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.880
 debilitating.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.880
 It's like, well, I'm done.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.760
 I ate the tub of ice cream.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.040
 I suck at this.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.690
 I'm just going to go get into

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.200
 bed and forget about it.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.640
 And in your grid, you show,

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.480
 wait, but you're still up here.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.340
 Like you can just make another

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.190
 good decision and then you're

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.320
 back up again.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.120
 And I like that idea of kind of

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.040
 navigating your ideas, not

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.940
 being so hard on ourselves.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.940
 Did I kind of get that right?

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.940
 Yeah.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.440
 So this is the, I don't know if

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.940
 you can see it, but this is the

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.500
 image.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.410
 But it's, it's a, it's this

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.000
 idea that like the difference

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.780
 between a good day and a bad

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.170
 day is often just a series of

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.260
 choices, right?

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.600
 And you can win each little

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.660
 moment, right?

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.800
 You can win each decisive

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.210
 moment just because you ate the

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.580
 tub of ice cream doesn't mean

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.540
 you can't win the next moment.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.680
 And, and so one thing that I

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.880
 was thinking about when I wrote

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.840
 that is this concept that

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.680
 I call decisive moments.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.120
 This idea that there are a few

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.390
 choices each day, maybe

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.080
 somewhere between say five and

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.260
 10 that kind of determine the

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.720
 next chunk of time.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.960
 And so, so for example, there's

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.910
 a moment for me each morning

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.640
 where I sit down and either

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.070
 I open up Evernote and I start

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.400
 writing the next start.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.090
 I'll call, I'm going to work on

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.520
, or I go to ESPN and I check

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.120
 the latest sports news.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.960
 And what happens in the next

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.880
 hour is really determined by

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.940
 what happens in like the first

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.940
 45 seconds.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.800
 You know, like, do I, do I go

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.820
 to Evernote or do I go to ESPN?

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.490
 And so that is a decisive

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.300
 moment in my language.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.500
 That's like a moment that

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.760
 determines if I can master

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.370
 those 45 seconds, then I can

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:47.660
 end

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.490
 up mastering the next hour that

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.900
 comes afterward almost

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.100
 automatically.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.100
 Same thing is true.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.540
 There's a moment each night,

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.190
 like 515 or so, my wife gets

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.660
 home from work and either we

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.660
 change into our workout clothes

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.180
, or we like sit on the couch

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.880
 and watch reruns the office

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.130
 and order Indian food or

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.880
 whatever.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.590
 And both of those nights are

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.540
 good nights, but the moment to

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.160
 master is do we change into

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.440
 our workout clothes or not?

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.240
 If we do that, it only takes a

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.280
 few minutes.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.250
 Everything else for the next

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.400
 two hours is already decided.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.560
 We'll get in the car, we'll

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.800
 drive to the gym, we'll do the

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.080
 reps, like it's all, it's all

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.800
 pretty much done at that point.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.860
 So the reason I like bringing

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.850
 that up or like thinking about

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.640
 that is you start to really

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.820
 realize there really isn't that

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.980
 much that you need to master.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.570
 Really you just are trying to

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:35.320
 focus your attention on a few

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.060
 key decisive moments throughout

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.060
 the day.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.670
 It's kind of like applying judo

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.540
 to your life.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.850
 It's like apply the pressure

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:43.100
 and the leverage at just the

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.500
 right point and then the next

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.550
 hour kind of falls into place

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.980
 automatically.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.240
 And so I like that because once

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.600
 you realize that, once you kind

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.660
 of identify those high

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.270
 leveraged decision points, you

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.600
 can organize your day and your

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.720
 environment around those

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.720
 things.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.690
 If I know that those 45 seconds

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.330
 where I'm choosing between E

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:04.800
vernote or ESPN is a real

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.140
 key moment, well, I could

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.300
 install freedom and then I

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.400
 could block ESPN from 8am to 10

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:12.640
am

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.690
 and that takes care of that

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:14.570
 decisive moment and it

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.650
 increases the odds that I'm

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:16.240
 going to

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.520
 open it instead.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.100
 But anyway, so little choices

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.500
 like that are easier to make

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.060
 once you've identified some

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.220
 of those key points of leverage

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:24.380
.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.910
 Yeah, and you talk in the book

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.200
 like there's some tricks to

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.280
 where you can make things

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.180
 automatic.

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.610
 You talk about Nira y'all

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.190
 buying a little device that

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.780
 just shuts off his internet

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.220
 every

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.220
 night at 10am.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.340
 Yeah, yeah, outlet timer.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.200
 Yeah, and what's brilliant

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.230
 about that is like it shuts it

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.020
 off, like especially if it's in

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.260
 the basement or whatever, like

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.090
 you're not going to go

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.160
 downstairs and like fiddle

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:49.520
 around

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.090
 with it and then it's just,

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:55.200
 that's what happens, right?

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.360
 If ESPN was really killing you,

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.370
 you could just cancel your

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.040
 cable subscription, that

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.070
 might be a bit, but then you go

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.320
 to watch ESPN, you can't, right

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:05.680
?

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.080
 It's done.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.050
 By the way, you mentioned this

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:11.790
 in the book too, but it's so

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.680
 funny how certain people's,

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.000
 it is a trigger for some people

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.980
 is not for others.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.530
 Like ESPN for me is not a, that

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.060
's not a temptation at all.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.150
 Yeah, it doesn't even enter

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.940
 your worldview.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.900
 Doesn't enter my worldview, but

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.650
 it shows you how identity is so

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.940
 much a part of this.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.410
 If I was hanging out with a

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.950
 bunch of Oilers fans every

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.860
 single day, and this happened

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:32.980
 in

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.330
 the co-work office, there's a

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:37.940
 few people and they're watching

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.700
 Oilers games on their computers

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:40.860
,

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.290
 but I realized like if I want

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.700
 to talk to them, I've got to

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.480
 start watching Oilers games.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.820
 So people like us do things

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.560
 like this.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.950
 And so I started developing

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.450
 this habit of watching Oilers

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:51.960
 games when, before I didn't

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.960
 even care.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.350
 I think that, I mean, I think

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:55.710
 this is one of the reasons why

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.000
 sports is so tribal, why

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.750
 people get so emotional about

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.190
 it, is that it becomes a

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.620
 connection point for the

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.680
 relationships.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.900
 It's not even, the game is

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.410
 actually, no one would ever say

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:06.840
 that because everybody acts

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.020
 like the game is the thing that

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:08.880
 matters the most.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.320
 But in a weird way, it's kind

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.580
 of a secondary thing.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.710
 Really, like when I think back

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.630
 for me, sports is a way for my

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.500
 brother and I to connect and

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.610
 for us to have something to

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:19.660
 text about and chat about

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.740
 throughout the week.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.000
 It's a thing that, it's a

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.380
 reason for my dad and I to get

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.740
 together in person and to go

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.180
 to games and hang out.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.160
 And like it's all the other

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.250
 stuff that it provides that

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.860
 makes it so deeply meaningful.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.300
 And then you end up assigning a

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.670
 lot of that emotion to how the

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:36.860
 team does on the field

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.220
 as well, you know, the scores

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.240
 on the scoreboard.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.580
 But yeah, it's a good example

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.320
 there.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.890
 On that topic then, and this is

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.180
 Corey Stone is asking this in

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.440
 chat, but there's a lot

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.890
 of people on Twitter that ask

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:49.480
 this too.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.640
 Given that example that you

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.410
 just gave, if your meaningful

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.520
 relationships are engaging in

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.520
 habits that might not be good

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.220
 for you or that you want to

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.430
 change, how do you navigate

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.840
 that?

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.960
 So if you're really feeling

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.690
 like I got to stop watching

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:07.740
 sports, it's just like I get

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.720
 a little bit and then I just go

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.880
 crazy, but I still want to have

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.420
 a relationship with my

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.060
 brother.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.420
 This is where it gets complex,

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.800
 especially if you're married to

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.500
 somebody.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.400
 If your wife is at least

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.880
 somewhat inclined to want to go

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.380
 to the gym, I'm guessing.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.740
 But if she was like, no, I just

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.090
 want to watch Netflix and order

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:28.860
 Indian food.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.980
 That's all I want to do.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.130
 How do you start to navigate

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:32.840
 those things?

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.780
 Yeah, those are good questions.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.290
 I mean, it's really hard

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:39.020
 because especially if it's a

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.860
 person who you want to stay in

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.020
 your

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.390
 life, you know, I think first

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.680
 of all, I just want to say, so

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.880
 I have some things I want

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.180
 to add to this, but I feel like

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.370
 it's worth noting that this

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.480
 question comes up a lot.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.350
 And I think the reason it comes

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.140
 up a lot is because we all know

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.880
 that actually there isn't

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.480
 a good, easy answer and that it

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.250
's like just a hard part of life

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:00.280
.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.280
 You know what I mean?

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.640
 Like everybody wants, it's one

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.900
 of those things we want to keep

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.260
 asking about in hopes that,

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.390
 oh, maybe there'll be an easy

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.300
 way to resolve this.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.950
 But I think we all know like it

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.420
's a challenge.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.760
 Now that said, there are a few

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.660
 things you can do.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.290
 So first thing is sometimes

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.120
 your friends and family want to

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.900
 do something different than

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.420
 how you want to change.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.260
 So like you want to stick to a

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.320
 new diet, they want to eat the

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.060
 old way or something like

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.060
 that.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.490
 So you want to start doing yoga

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.040
, they couldn't care less about

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.580
 yoga.

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.930
 They don't want to go to class

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:32.540
 with you.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.540
 Things like that.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.430
 Well, if that's the case, then

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.260
 for certain habits, you don't

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.940
 have to like fire your friends

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.310
 and family to be able to do

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:41.620
 that.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.120
 But what you can, what you do

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.770
 need or what can be really

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.080
 useful is having like a sacred

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.090
 space where that occurs where I

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.530
'm not saying you need to do

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.360
 this with me, but just don't

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.880
 make it harder on me, right?

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.220
 Just don't conflict with.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.560
 So the yoga example is an

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.170
 easier one where it's like,

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.020
 well, maybe you need to go to a

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.600
 yoga studio away from the

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.560
 friends and family that aren't

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.540
 interested and start to build

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.420
 friendships with people who are

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:06.580
.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.560
 I'm not saying you need to get

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.600
 rid of your old friends, but

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.500
 maybe it'd be helpful to

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.870
 build a couple of new ones who

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.240
 are into yoga so that you have

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.580
 like a safe space for that

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.580
 habit to live.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.700
 So that's one thing.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.370
 Then there's the second piece,

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.750
 which is sometimes you're

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.400
 building a habit that you do

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.020
 want the

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.780
 person to like join you on to

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.300
 come along with you.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.470
 You're working out and you

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.740
 would love for your spouse to

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.630
 join you at the gym or

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.200
 something

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.580
 like that.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.150
 Everybody know it like it would

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:35.590
 be good, but maybe they feel

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.140
 less comfortable there than

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.140
 you do.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.010
 Or maybe they feel you were

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:42.230
 previously an athlete and they

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.140
 were not.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.940
 And so you feel kind of

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:44.980
 comfortable in the gym.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.300
 You've been there before in

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.720
 years past, but for them it's

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.100
 like new and weird and they

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:49.260
 feel

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.120
 like they're being judged and

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:51.980
 whatever.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.380
 If you're dealing with a case

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.310
 like that, the thing that I try

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:56.660
 to keep in mind and I can

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.390
 tell you from working with my

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.660
 own family, it can be

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.700
 incredibly useful is praise the

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.820
 good ignore the bad.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.260
 It's very hard to do.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.950
 It's very the difficult part

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.560
 about it is not doing it on an

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.900
 individual basis.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.340
 It's that this needs to be the

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.640
 new lifestyle for you.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.420
 So when they do the thing that

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.270
 you're asking them to do, don't

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.860
 basically another way to

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.750
 phrase this is don't criticize

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.850
 people for doing what you were

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:22.940
 hoping they would.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.360
 There are so many times when

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.700
 the introverted kid in the

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.120
 family will come down to the

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:27.620
 dinner

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.040
 table and it's like, oh, look

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.220
 who decided to join us.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.120
 It's like, well, they finally

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.660
 did the thing that you were

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.620
 hoping they would do and engage

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.860
 with everybody.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.840
 And now they just feel like

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.050
 they're getting criticized for

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.300
 it.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.510
 Or you go to the gym and your

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.040
 spouse decides to join you and

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.300
 they do a few sets and then

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.300
 they feel like they're done.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.860
 And you say, well, that was a

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.260
 pretty short workout.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.880
 And what you should be saying

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.480
 is I think it's great that you

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.300
 got in here tonight, right?

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.560
 Like you weren't feeling it,

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.810
 but you were still able to make

00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:58.260
 it in.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.120
 And so praise the good ignore

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.220
 the bad.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.030
 And if you can do that in the

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.590
 long run, what ends up

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.670
 happening is everybody likes

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:08.380
 feeling

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.380
 praised.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.680
 Everybody likes feeling

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.380
 rewarded.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.170
 It feels satisfying to do

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:14.930
 something that the people who

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.860
 love you and who are around you

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.460
 praise you for.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.600
 And so at first you go to the

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.720
 gym and they say, hey, I'm

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.180
 really proud of you for getting

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.180
 in here tonight.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.180
 Good job.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.180
 And it doesn't seem like much.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.460
 But then after two months and

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.950
 three months and 10 months of

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:29.340
 that, you turn around a year

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.620
 later and they might never even

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.380
 say it.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:33.760
 But implicitly what they've

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.370
 realized is, damn, every time I

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.060
 go to the gym, it feels good.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.820
 They compliment me.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.280
 And that so now all of a sudden

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.880
 you start to associate going to

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.060
 the gym with feeling

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.180
 good.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.860
 And this is a really long game

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.540
 play because it takes a while

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.140
 for that to reinforce itself.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.160
 But same thing like the intro

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.100
verted kid at the table sits

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.140
 down and they say something

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.140
 that happened today.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:57.840
 And it's like, oh, that's

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.140
 awesome.

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.000
 Thanks for sharing that with us

00:45:59.000 --> 00:45:59.140
.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.770
 And like on that individual

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.810
 night, that one night at dinner

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.340
 doesn't count for a lot.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.110
 But if every time they speak up

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:07.990
, they're rewarded for it, then

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.540
 all of a sudden now they have

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.790
 a reason to start doing that

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:12.220
 more in the months and years to

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:12.620
 come.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.500
 So it takes a while.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.810
 But I think that that's like an

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:17.080
 effective way to gradually n

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.260
udge people in the right

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.260
 direction.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.260
 Yeah.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.150
 There's someone in the chat

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:22.010
 that's saying they need to

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.060
 apply that idea to themselves

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.960
 to avoid feeling guilty for not

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.020
 doing enough.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.720
 So instead of reinforce, oh,

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.390
 you idiot, you didn't go to the

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:30.180
 gym again.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.180
 You fatty.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.120
 You know, like that's not

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.940
 helpful.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.650
 Because the self talk, it can

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.340
 work with self talk as well.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.880
 This is why I think small

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.790
 habits can be so useful in some

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:42.900
 ways, even on the bad days,

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.160
 because like, let's say you're

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.390
 in that situation you just said

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:46.780
 where it's like, oh, you know,

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.780
 skip the gym again.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.780
 Yeah.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.300
 Well, you can still do one push

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.790
 up or one air squat or whatever

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:52.860
 before you go do a set

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.790
 of 10 air squats before you hop

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:55.860
 in bed tonight.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.550
 And it's not going to transform

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:58.970
 your body, but that's not

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.180
 really the point.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.450
 The point is to prove to

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.140
 yourself that it wasn't a good

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:03.660
 day.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.740
 I didn't have the best

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.020
 motivation or energy.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.700
 I had a long day at work, but I

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.460
 still am not the type of person

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.980
 who misses workouts.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.540
 I still proved to myself.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.130
 I still cast a vote for being

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.300
 that kind of person.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.590
 I didn't let a day go by

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.260
 without doing nothing.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.690
 And that can count for a lot in

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:22.060
 the long run.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.670
 And so sometimes small habits

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.340
 are less about the outcome they

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.820
 deliver and more about the

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.420
 identity they reinforce.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.420
 Yeah.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.510
 So I actually found, you know,

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.900
 another thing I tried to, I'm

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.540
 implementing in the new year

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.760
 is I decided to quit drinking

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.740
 alcohol.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.240
 And right now it's ostensibly

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.510
 for this goal of hitting a

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:44.940
 revenue mark once I hit the

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.100
 goal,

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.460
 then I can have a drink.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.740
 But the deeper motivation for

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.270
 me was I just realized like it

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.580
 just makes, it's a depressant.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.270
 It's like there's a bunch of

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.010
 reasons that it's not good for

00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:58.460
 me.

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.580
 And so my excuse or my way of

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.170
 trying it out is saying, well,

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:05.420
 I'm going for this goal.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.630
 But it's been interesting in

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:07.940
 social situations because all

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.420
 my friends still drink and that

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:09.420
's

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.900
 fine with me.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.800
 But sometimes just sharing the

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.690
 goal, oh, I'm just doing this

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.420
 because I'm going after this

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.940
 thing.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.500
 And you talk about how goals

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.020
 are sometimes helpful in

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.940
 setting your direction, you

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.140
 know,

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.050
 like, okay, I'm pointed this

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.140
 way now.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.910
 And sometimes sharing that with

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.140
 people is helpful.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.550
 The other thing is, I think

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.160
 eventually if I just keep doing

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.620
 this, just for me to say,

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:37.140
 well, I'm a non-drinker now.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.380
 And so I can still go and have

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.640
 my favorite, and it's also nice

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.420
 having a thing that you

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.420
 like.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.370
 So my favorite non-alcoholic

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:48.490
 drink is a non-alcoholic Caesar

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:48.820
.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.940
 It's like a Bloody Mary.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.210
 And to have that drink, it's

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:54.900
 like kind of spicy.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.540
 There's a reward there.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.710
 I also have this social crutch

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.810
 that I can use in a situation,

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:01.820
 you know.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.410
 And if somebody asks me about

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:04.680
 it, I also have this new

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.480
 identity, which is, oh, I'm a

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.260
 non-drinker

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.260
 now.

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.340
 I just don't drink.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.820
 And you talked about that.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:11.700
 There's some research behind

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:11.980
 that.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.410
 I know you've mentioned it a

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.040
 lot, but it's like I'm trying

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.420
 to quit smoking versus I'm

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.700
 a non-smoker, right?

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.700
 Is that correct?

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:20.700
 Correct, right?

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.700
 Yeah.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.710
 So I think that can be really

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:24.660
 helpful.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:25.660
 Yeah.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.500
 Having, I think what you're

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.940
 explaining here, the situation

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.940
 that you're going through, this

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.430
 experience you're having, is

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.030
 kind of, it's illustrating this

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:36.620
 process of identity change,

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.620
 right?

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:38.540
 It started with, oh, I'm just

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.130
 going to put it off for a

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.770
 little while while I'm

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:40.180
 attacking

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.180
 this goal.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.410
 But then you're casting so many

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.680
 votes for like, you know what,

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.900
 I haven't drank and like,

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.060
 I'm kind of benefiting from it.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.020
 Like maybe this is part of my

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:47.660
 identity now.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.420
 Maybe I'm a non-drinker.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.590
 And so anyway, yeah, I think

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:52.830
 you're definitely on the right

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:53.580
 track there.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.580
 Yeah.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.080
 And actually, this is a good

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.530
 time to bring up two Twitter

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:58.380
 questions.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.870
 Maria Aldry asks, you know, how

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:04.700
 do you maintain habits?

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.030
 Ask him about maintaining

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:07.170
 habits for people with

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.560
 depression, anxiety, or

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.780
 attention deficit.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.640
 Do you want to try to tackle

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.180
 that?

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.700
 Yeah.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.230
 So I've tried to be careful

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:16.930
 about saying that atomic habits

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.620
 is about building habits and

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.500
 breaking bad habits, building

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:21.300
 good ones.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:21.980
 But it's not a book on

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:22.500
 addiction.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.700
 It's not a book on depression.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.130
 It's not a book about anxiety

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.460
 or ADHD or any of these other

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.780
 disorders or ailments.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.450
 And I don't consider myself an

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.820
 expert on addiction.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.310
 However, something interesting

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:36.060
 has happened.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.800
 So I published the book and I

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.390
 have had a ton of speaking

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:40.940
 requests recently.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.350
 And so I've been doing speeches

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:43.700
 at conferences and companies

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.830
 and different events and

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:45.780
 whatever.

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.100
 And so many times, I get

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.590
 someone that comes up to me

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:49.920
 afterward or that asks a

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.580
 question

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.960
 during Q&A that talks about how

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.150
 useful the book was for their

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:57.100
 son who had ADHD or their

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.420
 cousin was a meth addict and

00:50:58.420 --> 00:50:59.900
 then was able to like start to,

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.260
 you know, write the ship

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.300
 by employing some of these

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.500
 techniques or whatever.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.500
 Yeah.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.500
 Which is great, which is very

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.060
 gratifying.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.450
 I still stand by my original

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:08.220
 statement.

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.580
 I'm not an expert on addiction.

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:10.840
 I don't want to like take a

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.580
 strong stance with this stuff.

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.060
 But what I've realized is that

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.020
 the principles that I lay out

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.700
 in atomic habits are really

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.220
 about how human behavior works.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.790
 It's about how habits are

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:22.500
 formed.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.710
 And whether that habit is

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:25.100
 something extreme, like an

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.610
 addiction or picking your skin

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:26.820
 or

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.800
 OCD or ADHD or whatever, or

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.900
 whether it's something more

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.160
 moderate like meditating for

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:33.660
 three minutes

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.160
 a day.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.840
 The fundamentals tend to be

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.620
 similar.

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.000
 And so I'm not going to say

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.180
 that the book offers a

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.040
 prescription for overcoming add

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:42.700
ictions.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.340
 But what I will say is you'd be

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.760
 hard pressed to find tactics in

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.020
 the book that wouldn't

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.580
 at least help, right?

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.260
 They wouldn't at least nudge

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.260
 people in the right direction.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.300
 I have heard from a few readers

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.550
 who specifically have said that

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:58.460
 they had ADHD and they found

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.040
 the book very helpful.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.300
 Environment design for whatever

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.470
 reason has been something that

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.460
's come up multiple times

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:05.850
 for folks who have struggled

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:06.540
 with that.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.370
 So I think it's kind of like if

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:10.220
 you're the type of person who

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.780
 is less likely to just

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.540
 remember to do it, right?

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.900
 Or just follow your to-do list.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.720
 If that's not you, then struct

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.620
uring an environment where it's

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.420
 easier to see the cues of your

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.310
 good habits, less likely to see

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:25.340
 the distractions, less friction

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.770
 between you and the good

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:27.700
 behavior,

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.040
 more friction between you and

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.780
 the bad ones.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.150
 If you place yourself in that

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:32.570
 space, it's much more likely

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:33.860
 that you're going to fall

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.860
 through.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.290
 You know, those are things that

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:37.670
 I talk about in chapters 6 and

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:38.260
 12.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.800
 But I think that the book

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.710
 applies, but I don't pitch it

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.510
 as like a prescription for

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.820
 someone

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.130
 dealing with a more serious

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:45.620
 issue.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.620
 Totally.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.770
 Yeah, and I would say, again, I

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.730
'm not an expert either, but as

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:52.300
 someone who has been dealing

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.490
 with depression the past couple

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.600
 years, having a professional

00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.820
 that you go to that deals with

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.980
 this stuff all the time like a

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.100
 therapist is so helpful.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.740
 And the therapist will be very

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.380
 interested if you read James'

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.180
 book.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.970
 So I said to my therapist, I'm

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:13.590
 like, you know, she starts way

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:14.420
 back here.

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.670
 And then she says, "So what's

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:16.420
 new with you?"

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.410
 I'm like, "Well, you know, I

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:18.440
 read this book and I'm thinking

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.460
, oh, what are you thinking

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.460
 about doing with that?"

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.670
 "Oh, I'm thinking about maybe

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.020
 quitting alcohol."

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.030
 "Oh, well, that's, you know,

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:28.030
 there's some reinforcement from

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:29.540
 the professionals."

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.230
 And likewise with my doctor,

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:34.610
 you know, when I had depression

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.020
 and I went to my physician,

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.180
 she said, she gave me two pres

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.520
criptions, quit drinking alcohol

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.980
 and quit taking any kind

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.260
 of cannabis.

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.000
 And the reason is she says, "

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.820
Those are going to make you feel

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.460
 bad."

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:53.850
 Now the trigger in that case

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:54.740
 was my doctor.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.470
 It's nice when you have a

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.600
 doctor saying, "Listen, this is

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.420
 your prescription."

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.830
 Oh, and double the amount of

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:00.060
 exercise I was doing.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.900
 So three things.

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.450
 Those, so I did that for three

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:05.960
 months and then, you know, I

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.500
 went back to my old habits.

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.310
 But now I have that memory of

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:10.450
 what it was like for three

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:12.300
 months and it's been a powerful

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.560
 trigger for me to, you know,

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.330
 when I am starting to notice my

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:18.000
 mood go down, I can, I

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:18.980
 remembered,

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.360
 you know, my doctor's

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.580
 prescription was quit drinking,

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.640
 quit, you know, eating edibles

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.420
 and

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.660
 doubling my exercise.

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.720
 And that's been helpful for me

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.340
 personally.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.690
 So I think if you're reading

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:32.350
 the book, let your professional

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:33.540
 in your life know about

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.540
 it.

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:35.540
 It's good.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.300
 And one thing I want you to do

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.460
 is, because I love the imagery,

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.300
 but, and this is probably

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.870
 unfair to you, is to give the

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:46.450
 ice cube example, but use

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:49.500
 Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.540
 So this is an example from the

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:55.660
 first chapter of the book.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:56.790
 And I actually, as a side note,

00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:57.700
 I thought about this.

00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:58.780
 I was like, man, we're going to

00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.740
 have to get these changed for

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.660
 the foreign editions.

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.590
 Like we're going to, it's going

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:02.580
 to need to be, but anyway, so.

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.580
 Yeah, I think you can do that.

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:04.580
 Yeah.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.580
 Yeah.

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.920
 The core idea is that the

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.750
 process of changing your habits

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.660
 is, well, it's similar to what

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.840
 we talked about early on, that

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.890
 there's often this valley of

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:14.780
 death, that there's this period

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.950
 where you're just kind of

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:17.420
 building up latent potential,

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:18.980
 but you're not really releasing

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.900
 any other results yet.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.580
 And I like to equate it to the

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:24.290
 process of heating up an ice

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:24.700
 cube.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.590
 So you've got this ice cube

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.180
 sitting on a table.

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:29.480
 And so let's say it's like

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.400
 negative three degrees in there

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:31.460
.

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.200
 So you're at negative three, it

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.940
's cold, you can see your breath

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:36.380
, the ice cube's sitting

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.030
 there, you heated up negative

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:39.300
 two, negative one.

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.620
 Still, there's this ice cube

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.460
 sitting there.

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.620
 Nothing has happened.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.070
 Then you go from negative one

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:45.660
 to zero.

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.130
 And all of a sudden, you have

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.470
 this one degree shift, no

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.060
 different than any of the other

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.950
 shifts that came before it, but

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:53.980
 you have this phase transition,

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.500
 right?

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.720
 And like the ice cube starts

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.020
 melting.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.780
 And that I think is indicative

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.460
 of what it often feels like to

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.620
 change a habit.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.880
 You're making these little

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.460
 improvements, you're trying to

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:05.910
 make these 1% changes, these

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:06.020
 one

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.660
 degree shifts each day.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.150
 And you're like, it's really

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.700
 easy to get frustrated or even

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.100
 depressed at that point.

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.320
 You know, it's like, I've been

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.530
 running for three weeks, how

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:16.500
 come I can't see a change

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.500
 in my body?

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.950
 Or I've been writing blog posts

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:20.220
 for six months now, how come

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.580
 this site isn't popular yet?

00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.560
 And the key point there is your

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.590
 work was not being wasted, it's

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:28.140
 just being stored.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.810
 Complaining about sticking to a

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:31.340
 habit for two months or three

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.660
 months or even six months

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.970
 or a year and not having the

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:35.400
 outcome that you want is kind

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.740
 of like complaining about

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.210
 heating an ice cube from

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:40.130
 negative three to negative one

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.060
 degrees and not melting it.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.370
 The work was not wasted, it's

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:44.380
 just being stored.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.440
 And I love that quote that's in

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.470
 that same section from Jacob

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:50.140
 Reese, who it hangs in

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.410
 the locker room of the San

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:53.040
 Antonio Recruitment, won five

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.300
 NBA championships.

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.560
 And it says essentially, when I

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.100
 feel like giving up, I think

00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.580
 about the stone cutter

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.530
 who continues to hammer away at

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.090
 the stone a hundred times

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:04.740
 without it splitting.

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.880
 And then finally, on the 101st

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.460
 blow, it cracks in two.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.700
 And I know that it wasn't the

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:10.900
 hundred that can't there.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.430
 I know it wasn't the 101st

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:13.680
 swing that did it, but the

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.180
 hundred that came before.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.020
 And like it's that same idea.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.630
 You know, the reason the site

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:20.240
 takes off is not because of the

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.700
 one viral article, it's

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.450
 because of the 55 that you

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:25.130
 wrote in the weeks and months

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.740
 prior.

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.070
 The reason that you see a

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:28.470
 change in your body is not

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:29.890
 because today's workout

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:30.540
 radically

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.070
 transform you, it's because you

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:33.280
've been sticking to it for

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.300
 eight months now.

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.470
 And it's really about showing

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:38.090
 up, continue to put those

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:40.180
 swings in, continue to raise

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.100
 the temperature by one degree.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.450
 And eventually you hit that

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:44.920
 phase transition where you can

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.500
 see the results of your work.

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.500
 Yeah.

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.050
 And that image has been so

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.420
 powerful in my life.

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.420
 The re like I've been telling

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.050
 people about this book and I

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:57.940
 actually notice there's kind

00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:59.700
 of like a coffee shop test.

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.190
 Like if I hear people talking

00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:02.810
 about something from Internet

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:04.280
 culture in a coffee shop, like

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.050
 real people, then something's

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:09.220
 hit and atomic habits is like

00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:09.940
 that.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.240
 Like it hit the kind of

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.570
 mainstream and that image of

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.570
 just raising the temperature a

00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:19.380
 little

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.700
 bit every day.

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.300
 Now I feel like I'm a few

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:27.480
 months into this and I'm a

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.170
 little bit kind of like

00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:31.860
 evangelical

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:32.860
 about it.

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.370
 And now I'm like, God, like my

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:37.480
 life is so much better.

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.650
 And it's because of just these

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:41.900
 little changes over time in the

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.400
 same direction.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.920
 I can now I can see it.

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.430
 Now I can see that I feel

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:47.200
 better.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.580
 You know, wow, man, quitting

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.160
 alcohol.

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.160
 That was one thing.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.440
 And then wow, showing up at the

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.770
 gym three or four times a week,

00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:53.800
 that really helps.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.100
 And wow, like reading a real

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.470
 book every night before I go to

00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.880
 bed.

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.810
 All of these things keep kind

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:00.420
 of adding up and do make a

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.620
 meaningful difference in your

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:03.820
 life.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:04.830
 Even though way back when when

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:06.000
 you're starting, you feel like,

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.260
 well, nothing's going to help

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.260
 me now.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.410
 It's I want to be clear that

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:14.750
 this these ideas have meaning

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:16.980
fully impacted my life.

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:18.410
 So I'm yeah, I'm really

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:19.260
 thankful.

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:20.270
 I'm thankful you wrote that

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.540
 book.

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.400
 I'm thankful you you talked to

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.540
 me in the airport.

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.140
 It's been really great for me.

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.440
 That's awesome.

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:27.430
 Thank you so much for sharing

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.760
 that.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.170
 And ultimately, that's what the

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:30.480
 whole thing is for, right?

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.690
 I mean, it just it makes it

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:32.860
 feel like it was worth the

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.080
 effort to spend a few years

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:34.560
 writing

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.560
 it and working on it.

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.560
 So that's great.

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.150
 And so before you go, some

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.830
 people are asking like what

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:41.590
 recommendations for system

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:42.760
 services,

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.080
 tools, trackers.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.150
 I know you have a new one

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.880
 coming out.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.880
 Do you want to talk about that?

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:47.880
 Sure.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.880
 Yeah.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.450
 So I got it right here next to

00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:49.880
 me, actually.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.680
 So this is a habit journal.

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.240
 And we we just launched it two

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.460
 weeks ago.

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.050
 And it's got it's basically a

00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:58.340
 dot grid notebook.

00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.490
 So if you're into bullet journ

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:00.640
aling or you're into keeping a

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.020
 notebook or use a notebook,

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.560
 the vast majority of it are dot

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.260
 grid pages.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.470
 So you'll be able to use it

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:06.580
 like any normal one.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.250
 But then at the back, there's a

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.780
 section with a habit tracker

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:10.620
 templates.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.820
 And I don't know if you can see

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.070
 that very well, but I've been

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:13.580
 using it.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.730
 For example, this is this month

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:14.900
.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.170
 So you can see me tracking my

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:18.580
 habits on here.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.320
 And so anyway, those templates

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.730
 are in the back and they're

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:22.880
 also perforated.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.820
 So you can tear them out and

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.750
 put them on your desk or put

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:26.080
 them on your kitchen counter or

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.120
 your refrigerator or whatever.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.530
 And then and then at the very

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.190
 beginning of the book, there is

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:32.600
 a section called one line

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.120
 per day.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.610
 So I've been using it for what

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:36.680
 happened today.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.360
 And so I've been writing down

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.920
 what happened each day.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.520
 And there are 31 lines.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.000
 So one for each day of the

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:43.640
 month.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.880
 And there are 12 of them.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.890
 So by the time you get to the

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:47.060
 end of the year, you should be

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.240
 able to flip through and see

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.450
 if you I'm doing what happened

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:53.090
 today, Sean Blanc, it does what

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:53.900
's the highlight of the

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.380
 day.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.800
 Some other ones that I've seen

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.220
 are what am I grateful for?

01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.190
 Or you could use it as like a

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:00.140
 productivity thing.

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.530
 You could say like, what's my

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:02.980
 most important task today?

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.980
 Things like that.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.270
 So there are a lot of examples

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:06.620
 in the back of the notebook who

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:07.900
 I have like 16 pages of

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.700
 examples of how to use it.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.310
 But anyway, it's called the

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:12.420
 habit journal.

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.180
 And yeah, I'm excited about it.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.410
 I think it'll be a good tool to

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:16.990
 help people build better habits

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.060
.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.380
 And a lot of folks, I've heard

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.700
 from a lot of folks that really

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.840
 like the audiobook.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.610
 So if you folks aren't readers,

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:24.320
 go check out the audiobook.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.100
 People like us read atomic

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.680
 habits.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.740
 So thanks again for your time,

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:31.120
 James.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.360
 Really appreciate it, man.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360
 Awesome.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:44.600
 Thank you.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600
 There you go.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.700
 That was helpful for you.

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.230
 Like I said, I really recommend

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:51.900
 the book, Atomic Habits.com.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:53.800

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.900
 about is also available there.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.780
