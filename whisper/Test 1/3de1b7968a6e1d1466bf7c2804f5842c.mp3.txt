 Hey, product people.
 Justin Jackson here, and I've
 got a brand new interview for
 you with James Clear, who
 is the author of Atomic Habits,
 a book that has really changed
 my life since I've read
 it.
 And I don't want to give too
 much of an intro.
 I just want to get right into
 the actual interview.
 If you like this, please reach
 out to James on Twitter @JamesC
lear.
 And if you have comments about
 the episode, reach out to me on
 Twitter.
 I'm the letter M, the letter I,
 Justin, M, I, Justin.
 Here is me and James talking
 about habits and how you can
 make your life better one
 day at a time.
 The book, your book's been out
 for a while.
 It's right here, Atomic Habits.
 If you see it in an airport or
 something near you, how long
 has it been out now?
 Today is 100 days exactly.
 No way.
 Yeah, so just over three months
.
 I'm curious, because now it's
 been out for a while.
 Is there one idea that you see
 that people keep sharing, like
 one idea that resonated
 from the book in particular
 that gets shared more than
 anything else on Twitter or
 whatever?
 So I was curious about that
 myself when I was writing the
 book and thinking about it,
 because I kind of felt like,
 all right, hopefully all these
 ideas are useful.
 What's the one thing that
 people are going to latch on to
?
 Because sometimes you'll hear
 that from authors that there
 was one chapter or something
 that
 was the chapter that really
 stuck with people.
 I'm grateful for the fact that
 there are a variety of things,
 but there are a few things.
 So the first one is identity-
based habits, which is chapter
 two.
 And that concept really seems
 to have resonated with people,
 the idea of trying to reinforce
 your desired identity and
 starting with who you want to
 become rather than what you
 want
 to achieve.
 And I'm glad that it did,
 because that was the chapter I
 debated over the most of where
 to put it in the book.
 At different points, it was the
 first chapter.
 It was the last chapter.
 It ended up being the second
 one.
 I also had this thought in my
 head that it should be about
 midway through the book.
 So it really jumped all over
 the place, but I ended up
 thinking, I feel like this is
 one
 of the best ideas, so I want to
 have it early so that people,
 even if they don't finish
 the book, they still come
 across this idea.
 And I'm glad that that ended up
 working out well.
 The other one that people bring
 up a lot is the two-minute rule
 and the idea of scaling
 your habits down to the point
 where they take two minutes or
 less.
 I think that that's a very
 actionable one.
 It's like, OK, I know exactly
 what to do.
 I wanted to do a workout, but
 now I'll just focus on doing
 five push-ups.
 Or I wanted to read 30 books
 this year, and now I'll focus
 on reading one page a day or
 something like that.
 Got you.
 So I think the actionableness
 of that one also tends to stick
.
 And so going back to the
 identity one, is this the idea
 that every action you take or
 every habit you develop is a
 vote for the person you want to
 become?
 Right.
 So that's kind of like my core
 philosophy behind it, this idea
 that the way that we develop
 beliefs about ourselves, that
 we reinforce our self-image,
 that we develop our identity
 to a certain degree, is largely
 reinforced by the experiences
 and behaviors that we perform
 over time.
 So some aspects of your
 identity are relatively fixed,
 like, for example, if you're
 tall or
 short.
 Even that idea that I am tall
 or I am short, that's
 reinforced.
 You learn that through
 experiences in life.
 Now there are many aspects of
 your identity that are less
 fixed than that, but are still
 reinforced by your experiences.
 So if you write one sentence
 today, you probably don't think
 about yourself as I am a writer
.
 But if you do that every day
 for six months or nine months
 or a year, at some point you
 turn around and you think, "Huh
, maybe I am the kind of person
 who is a writer."
 Or if you study biology every
 Tuesday night for 20 minutes,
 you at some point think, "I
 guess I'm studious.
 I keep doing this every week.
 Maybe this is the kind of
 person I am."
 And so I like that idea that
 our habits are like votes for
 the type of person we believe
 that we are, that they build up
 evidence of looking at
 ourselves in a certain way.
 And I like to phrase it that
 way not only because I believe
 that it's true, but also
 beliefs and behavior are kind
 of a two-way street.
 So you'll hear people say
 things like, "Just be positive
 or just believe in yourself or
 fake it till you make it," or
 things like that.
 And there's nothing necessarily
 wrong with fake it till you
 make it.
 It's fine to be positive and
 believe things about yourself,
 but it's a very short-term
 strategy because fake it till
 you make it is asking you to
 believe something about
 yourself
 without having evidence for it.
 It's like that kind of
 visualization stuff or mantra
 stuff where you look at
 yourself
 in the mirror and you tell
 yourself, "I am a writer.
 I am a writer," even though you
 haven't written yet.
 And so what I'm saying is
 similar, but I think
 importantly different in the
 sense that you
 let the behavior lead the way
 rather than the belief.
 And I think that's the best
 lever we have for changing the
 way that we look at ourselves,
 which is to say, show up and
 write a sentence every day, and
 soon you're going to have
 something
 to root that new identity of, "
I am a writer in."
 And it's a much more, I think,
 robust and long-term way of
 changing how you look at
 yourself.
 Yeah, I think for me the...
 Because you first communicated
 that idea to me in an airport
 in Denver.
 Yeah, I remember that.
 And at the time in my life, I
 was not doing so good.
 I was depressed.
 I was, I think, cynical.
 Especially, I think cynical
 about people like you that seem
 to have it all together, that
 seem to be really like doing
 all the good habits.
 And when you're not doing so
 good, looking at someone that
 seems to have it all together
 just can make you more grumpy
 or more cynical or more
 whatever.
 But I remember you sitting down
 and kind of hashing this out
 with me.
 And that idea of, "Justin, no
 matter where you're at right
 now and no matter what you've
 done, you could start today
 with one action."
 So if you go running today,
 that might not make a big
 difference.
 And then if you do it tomorrow
 and then the next day and then
 the next day and then the
 next day, at the end of the
 week, you might say, "Well,
 wait a second.
 I think I'm a runner."
 And maybe after a couple of
 weeks, you might say, "Well, I
'm going to get myself some
 runner
 clothes and go and get some
 runner clothes.
 And then I'm going to get
 myself a good pair of...
 Shoot, I'm going to install
 that Strava app."
 And all of a sudden you could
 see yourself.
 That was a really hopeful
 message for me when I was
 really struggling to figure out
.
 It was way easier for me to be
 cynical and just kind of look
 back at all these people
 implementing good, healthy
 processes and say, "Well, that
's not for me.
 That's just for people that
 whatever."
 But seeing, hearing that gave
 me hope to think, "I could do
 that.
 And it's surprising how little
 time it takes to accomplish
 that.
 Is that something...
 Have other people been kind of
 referencing that too?
 Is that part of the...
 And maybe that's what's so good
 about having it as chapter two
 because it gives me some
 hope, right?
 Right, yeah.
 Well, what's interesting is
 that that process of changing
 in that way, it's happening
 anyway.
 If you think back to the
 beginning, for example, if I
 think of the early days of my
 entrepreneurial
 career, well, I didn't have any
 entrepreneurs in my family.
 I didn't have any close friends
 who were entrepreneurs.
 There was no reason for me to
 think that's who I am or to
 feel like I was externally
 validated with that was part of
 my identity.
 I had no evidence of it.
 And so early on, all I had was
 hope, right?
 The hope that, "Oh, maybe I'll
 be able to build something.
 Maybe I'll be able to make this
 work."
 But then you start to show up,
 and for me, it was probably
 about two years in.
 It's probably about where I
 kind of like the scale tipped,
 and I started to think, "I am
 an entrepreneur.
 That's part of who I am."
 But it really took proving it
 to myself that I can pay my
 bills through this, that I can
 like actually have a lifestyle
 and a career in this way.
 I had to prove it for about two
 years before I really started
 to latch onto it and say,
 "This is who I am."
 And so my point is, that's
 always happening.
 You're continually updating
 your beliefs about yourself
 based on the experiences that
 you're
 going through.
 And all I'm talking about is
 simply designing that process
 in a little more careful or
 thoughtful
 way rather than just kind of
 letting it happen to you and be
 like, "Well, I guess I'll
 figure
 out who I am based on what life
 throws at me versus how about I
 figure out who I am based
 on the votes that I cast each
 day and what habits I decide to
 follow?"
 Yeah, yeah.
 Again, that is a very hopeful
 message for someone who's just
 kind of sitting back and
 waiting for it to happen.
 What sustains you when you're
 in the process but not there
 yet?
 Like you mentioned entrepreneur
 and you're like, "Man, it took
 a long time."
 What sustains you?
 Good question because I think a
 lot of habits, entrepreneurship
 is certainly this way, exercise
 is this way where the rewards
 of a habit are often very
 delayed.
 What's the reward for working
 out for three weeks?
 Not really a whole lot,
 honestly.
 Your body hasn't really changed
.
 The scale is probably about the
 same.
 You're probably just sore.
 There probably isn't a whole
 lot to show for it.
 It's really not unless you
 stick with that habit for three
 months or six months or a
 year that you actually start to
 see the changes you were hoping
 to get when you set out.
 There's this valley of death in
 the beginning where in a way it
 gets harder before it gets
 easier.
 It feels uncomfortable.
 You feel sore and pain.
 You feel uncertain when you
 walk in the gym.
 You feel like people are
 judging you.
 Same way with starting a
 business.
 In a weird way, it's harder
 before it gets easier.
 You start out, but you're not
 making any money.
 You feel stupid a lot of the
 time because you don't know how
 to make a sales call or
 what customers are looking for
 or whether you're even offering
 the right product.
 I remember when I first started
, like I said, I didn't know
 anybody.
 Didn't have any entrepreneurs
 in my family.
 I was like, "Well, I need to
 get to know some people."
 I sent a bunch of emails to
 reach out and just ask if
 people would chat on Skype for
 like 30 minutes or whatever.
 I remember sending those first
 few and thinking, "Do people
 even do this?
 Do people chat on Skype with
 people that they haven't met
 before?
 Is this a weird thing to ask?"
 There's just a lot of that
 uncertainty early on.
 Your point is, I think, a valid
 one, which is, "Well, what do
 you do to get through that?
 How do you get through that
 valley of death while you're
 waiting for the long-term
 rewards
 to accumulate?"
 I think that this is where
 psychologists call it
 reinforcement or an external
 reinforcer,
 that you want some kind of
 reinforcement that is enjoyable
 in the moment so that you have
 a reason to keep showing up.
 There are from a habit
 standpoint, there are two ways
 to do this.
 First thing is just a strategic
 choice about what type of habit
 you choose to follow.
 If we go back to the exercise
 example, well, not everybody
 has to work out like a body
 builder.
 You could do Pilates or yoga or
 go for a run or rock climbing
 or all kinds of stuff.
 Pick the form of a habit that
 brings you the most joy, that
 is most enjoyable to you.
 It's going to be a slog for,
 you're going to have to swim
 for months to see a change
 in your body.
 You're going to have to cycle
 for months.
 You're going to have to lift
 weights for months.
 It doesn't really matter which
 one you choose.
 It's going to take a while.
 You might as well choose the
 one that's most exciting or
 enjoyable to you.
 Same way with like, imagine a
 reading habit.
 You don't have to read.
 You might feel like, "Oh, I
 have a business, so I need to
 read business books."
 But really ultimately, the most
 important thing is do you get
 in the habit of reading?
 Do you fall in love with
 reading?
 If you need to start with sci-
fi books or fantasy or something
 like that, well, start
 with that.
 Do the one that is intrins
ically valuable to you at first.
 Once the habit is built, then
 you can transition to some of
 the other stuff.
 That's one method for getting
 through that valley of death.
 Yeah.
 I think this brings up maybe a
 harder question, which is, so
 based on your book, it's
 January
 and I'm thinking, "Okay, I
 haven't been in the gym for
 seven years.
 I used to love working out.
 I'm going to go.
 I got my streaks app on my
 phone.
 Start going."
 I've probably been, I don't
 know, I've probably been at
 least 18 days or maybe even 20
 days
 this month.
 It's great.
 I was surprised by how fast I
 felt.
 The first day, I felt like I
 didn't belong.
 I felt awkward.
 I don't know anybody here I'm
 walking in.
 Some of the machinery, I
 recognize.
 Some I don't.
 I have to get back into a
 routine.
 I have to find which exercise I
'm going to do.
 There's all these insecurities
 and questions.
 But after a week, I felt like I
 belonged.
 But I wonder if that's because
 it was easier for me.
 I had this, I'm relatively, I
 was already relatively in shape
.
 There's a big difference
 between going in where you feel
 like, "Oh, maybe I'm a few
 pounds overweight."
 Going in and being 200 pounds
 overweight.
 There's a big difference
 between going in even as a
 white male compared to, there's
 a big difference going in and
 feeling like, "Well, I've done
 these exercises before so
 I'm not completely out of my
 element."
 And I'm wondering how, I mean,
 are habits like that achievable
 because of privilege
 and context and other things.
 How much does that play into it
?
 And if someone is walking in
 and they're 200 pounds
 overweight, do they still have
 the
 same chance of progress and
 success?
 It just feels like such a big
 mountain for them to go over.
 For sure.
 Yeah.
 So, this is one reason why I
 think starting with small
 habits is so incredibly
 important
 because a lot of the time when
 we think about the outcome that
 you want, so just to continue
 your weight loss or exercise
 example, everybody gets wrapped
 up and like, "Oh, I want to
 lose
 100 pounds or I want to lose 20
 pounds or whatever the number
 is."
 But you forget about there,
 like all these little log
istical and emotional details
 that
 come along with starting a new
 habit.
 So I'll often tell the story
 about, I have this reader who,
 he ended up losing over 100
 pounds.
 And one of the first things he
 did was he went to the gym, but
 he wasn't allowed to
 stay for longer than five
 minutes.
 So he drove to the gym, got out
 of the car, did half an
 exercise, got back in the car,
 drove home.
 And it sounds ridiculous to
 people.
 It sounds silly because it's
 like, "Well, clearly exercising
 for five minutes is not
 going to get you in shape."
 I guess not.
 But what you realize is he was
 mastering the art of showing up
.
 He was becoming the type of
 person that drove to the gym
 every day.
 And when you're in that state,
 for him at that point, that was
 the biggest shift was,
 "Can I just become the type of
 person who gets in here, who
 overcomes the uncertainty
 or feeling uncomfortable or
 feeling judged?"
 And all those things are very
 real hurdles to building a
 habit.
 There are all these little
 questions that need to be
 answered for something like
 that.
 Like, "Okay, I want to go to
 the gym.
 Well, what time am I going to
 go?
 Am I going to go before work or
 after work?
 What gym will I go to?
 What route am I going to take
 to get there?
 Do I need to bring a water
 bottle or is there like a water
 fountain at the gym?"
 And all those little questions
 like that, like whether or not
 there's a water fountain
 at the gym, it sounds small.
 But if you already feel
 uncomfortable and feel like you
 don't belong and then you
 always
 forget to bring your water
 bottle and you're like, "Oh,
 there's nothing ever, and there
's
 never anything to drink there."
 That's enough friction to get
 you to quit in the beginning.
 So starting with something
 simple, like, "All I'm going to
 do is I'm going to show up and
 I'm going to do one exercise
 for five minutes and then I'm
 going to go."
 That I think is a good way to
 start.
 And it reminds me of what
 Steven Pressfield wrote.
 I think it was in the War of
 Art where he said something to
 the effect of like, "If
 you sit down each day at the
 computer and you do your
 writing, at some point, at
 first
 it feels uncomfortable, but at
 some point that becomes your
 territory."
 And I really like that phrasing
 of it because for an animal,
 for a wolf or something, a
 piece of land does not become
 their territory unless they
 spend time in it, right?
 Unless they are there each day.
 It has to become comfortable
 first.
 And so for many people building
 habits, whether that's getting
 into the gym or going to the
 yoga studio or sitting your
 butt in the chair and writing,
 you need to make that space
 your
 territory.
 And the very first step is not
 getting a result.
 It's spending time there.
 It's making that little bit of
 land a zone where you feel like
, "This is where I belong
 each day."
 And that's a big emotional
 hurdle to cross before you even
 worry about any of the physical
 or actual technical things to
 do.
 Yeah.
 And I mean, the other thing
 that helped is I went with my
 wife and it's funny because
 I felt like I'm like Mr. Conf
ident, but she was like, at one
 point, she's like, "Justin,
 you are so nervous right now."
 She could tell how nervous I
 was.
 But I thought I was keeping it
 all together.
 And it just reminded me of, I'd
 been to gyms from the time I
 was in grade nine all the
 way through college.
 It wasn't like it was
 unfamiliar, but I was nervous
 because it was unfamiliar.
 There had been a seven-year gap
 and now I was exploring this
 again, worried about what
 these people are thinking about
 me.
 "Wow, that guy looks like he's
 way more fit than me."
 All these thoughts go through
 your head.
 And so, yeah, I think kind of
 figuring out how you can make a
 step and sometimes maybe
 it's like going with somebody
 so you at least have some
 emotional, because it's
 emotional.
 It's nice to have someone to
 kind of share the emotional
 burden, right?
 For sure.
 Well, if you come, the thing
 that ultimately what you're
 looking to do is, like we just
 said, feel like it's part of
 your territory.
 And because there are other
 people in that space, what that
 also means is you're looking
 to feel like you're part of the
 tribe who goes there, right?
 You belong with the other
 people who are in that room.
 And so it helps to, what is a
 tribe?
 Well, it's a group of people
 that you get along with, that
 you bond with, that you belong
 to over something else, over
 some shared interest.
 And in other words, it's a
 group in a lot of ways of
 friends, friends who share some
 kind of interest.
 So these are your gym friends.
 Well, if you go with your wife,
 then you automatically have at
 least one person in the tribe
 that
 you are friends with, that you
 do belong with.
 And so I think that helps you
 get over that hurdle a little
 bit.
 You're no longer facing that
 challenge alone.
 Before it was like, I am trying
 to get fit.
 Now it is we are trying to get
 fit.
 And that helps a lot with the
 kind of the mental feeling of
 like, do I belong or not?
 Yeah.
 So I don't mean to stay on this
 too long, but it's so fresh
 that the other thing I found
 myself doing, because I'm
 interested in the emotional
 friction behind habits.
 And so the other thing I was
 doing is I was going in there
 and I'm uncomfortable.
 So I'm trying to act really
 tough, but I'm not tough at all
.
 But when people look at me, I'm
 kind of like scowling when like
 I'm not being friendly.
 I'm not being myself.
 And I was thinking about that
 and thinking like when you're
 kind of inward focused and
 you're in a new environment and
 you're trying to develop a new
 habit, but you're inward
 focused,
 it really is, it doesn't really
 help.
 And so I had to kind of turn
 that around and go, okay, I got
 to start being friendly.
 I got to start saying hi to
 these people, because if I wave
 at this person and it feels
 good, like they respond with a
 smile.
 And that happens again next
 time.
 And again, next time, that's a
 little bit of a reward for me.
 That's going to keep me going
 to the gym.
 But if I keep going here with
 this like tough scowl on my
 face, and it's hard because you
 feel like you don't belong.
 You feel nervous.
 And you kind of default to
 these weird behaviors.
 And it took a little bit of
 time, but I realized, okay, now
 I got to get in the habit of
 smiling
 and saying hello when I'm in
 the gym, not just being like in
 my own zone and pretending
 I'm somebody I'm not, right?
 Well, that's one thing that
 kind of helps you start to
 belong or become part of the
 rest of the tribe.
 Just a friendly behavior helps
 you start to develop
 friendships with some of those
 other
 people that are there.
 Yeah.
 A study that I wanted to cite
 in Atomic Habits, but I couldn
't find it to track it down.
 But I read about it years ago,
 where the YMCA ran a survey.
 And when they surveyed people
 who were joining the gym, the
 thing that got them to join
 were
 the different classes offered,
 the equipment that was in the
 gym, basically facilities
 and features were the things
 that got people in for the
 first time.
 But then when they surveyed
 members who had been there for
 over a year, the thing that
 got people to stick, nobody
 mentioned features or
 facilities.
 Everybody mentioned friendships
.
 And so the people who actually
 stayed at the gym or kept their
 membership were the ones
 who ended up developing
 friendships with other people
 there.
 And I think you're right.
 Ultimately, the thing that gets
 you to come back is like, do I
 enjoy coming here?
 Does it mean I get to see some
 of my friends?
 Does it mean I get to hang out
 with people I like?
 Or, you know, it's really the
 sense of belonging that gets
 habits to stick.
 And the action itself is just
 kind of like something that's
 happening along the way.
 Yes.
 But there's a step before that
 that we kind of skipped over,
 which is like, how do you
 even choose a habit in the
 first place?
 Like how does that happen?
 In the sense of, I might not
 know what's good for me.
 So how does that come into this
?
 Yeah.
 Well, there are a lot of ways
 to answer that question.
 So I'll just share a couple of
 thoughts that come to mind.
 So the first thought that comes
 to mind is this question from,
 I first heard from Seth
 Godin, which I think is just a
 great question, which is, what
 is it for?
 And so this is a question that
 we need to ask ourselves when
 we're trying to build a
 new habit, which is, what is
 this habit for?
 What am I actually trying to
 achieve here?
 Because the correct habit to
 choose is very different based
 on what your goals are, what
 you're hoping to get as an
 outcome, what kind of lifestyle
 you want.
 And so for example, the habit
 of making 20 sales calls a day.
 Well, if what it's for is to
 increase revenue and to build a
 successful business, that's
 a wonderful thing.
 If you hate making sales calls
 and you want to spend less time
 working and more time with
 your family, that could be a
 terrible habit to build.
 It just depends on what it's
 for.
 So that's one question to ask,
 but you are correct that we
 often don't know what we need
 in the moment.
 And I think part of that is
 just a challenge of life and a
 challenge of self-awareness
 and knowing what you need, but
 life is a very complex system.
 And so figuring out the right
 thing for that is sometimes
 just impossible or too many
 moving
 parts.
 So I tend to default to two
 possible answers.
 The first answer is, we all
 need things that are so boring
 that we don't think about them,
 but are incredibly important
 for showing up each day.
 So did you sleep eight hours?
 Are you drinking enough water?
 Are you spending a little bit
 of time walking outside or
 getting a little bit of
 sunlight?
 Do you exercise consistently?
 Whatever form is interesting to
 you?
 Are you spending some time
 reading and soaking up new
 ideas?
 I'm not saying you have to do
 all that stuff every day, but
 my point is those are things
 that most people would be like,
 "Yeah, of course, you should
 sleep and read more books
 and exercise.
 Everybody knows that's good."
 But your time is almost never
 going to be wasted by making
 sure you do one of those things
.
 It's a fundamental that's worth
 spending time on that's worth
 coming back to, that's worth
 reminding yourself of, even if
 you aren't sure the ideal
 perfect place to focus in your
 life.
 So that's the first answer.
 Come back to the fundamentals.
 The second answer is more broad
.
 I can't be specific with it
 because it depends on each
 person, but the broad
 application
 is what I would call broad
 funnel tight filter.
 So whenever you're trying to
 figure out where to focus, you
 need a really broad range of
 research, try to get as many
 options as possible, then apply
 a really tight strict filter to
 it and just focus on the one or
 two best options that you found
.
 So for example, I just finished
 Atomic Habits a few months ago,
 so now I'm thinking, "Should
 I write a second book?
 If I should, what should that
 be about?"
 And I don't know right now, so
 I'm in the broad funnel stage.
 So I want to lay out as many
 options as possible.
 I want to brainstorm a thousand
 titles.
 I want to look at all the top
 books on Amazon.
 I want to browse my best
 performing tweets and see if
 there's a possible thread for a
 book idea in there.
 I want to look everywhere I can
 and just list all of that stuff
 in the same spreadsheet.
 And maybe I got 1200 ideas on
 there, really broad funnel.
 But then I need to apply a very
 tight filter.
 Is this something I'm
 interested in enough to spend
 two or three or four years
 working
 on?
 Is it a topic of broad appeal
 to a general audience?
 Are there going to be a lot of
 people that like this?
 Is this something that I can
 actually turn into something
 actionable?
 Can people use this in their
 daily life?
 Is this a topic that has a lot
 of stories that I could tell?
 Can I actually make this
 entertaining or latch on to
 other interesting stories to
 make the
 book readable?
 Yes.
 And those are just some of the
 filters.
 But my point is that you want
 some period of very broad
 exploration, and then once you
 have a lot of options, you want
 to really tighten it down based
 on that question, what
 is this for?
 So in my case, the question I'm
 using is, well, it's for
 writing a good book, one that's
 highly actionable, one that
 sells a lot of copies, one that
 people find useful, and so
 on.
 And so I think if you combine
 that broad funnel type filter
 strategy and that question of
 what is it for, that can maybe
 give you some more specific
 answers.
 But even if you don't come up
 with something good there, you
 can always focus on the
 fundamentals.
 And the other thing, when you
 mentioned Seth Godin, he has
 this other line, which is
 people
 like us do things like this.
 I love that line.
 I wish I had thought it up, but
 yeah, it's so good.
 It's such a great mantra.
 And what's interesting about it
 is, like for me, one thing that
 made me start thinking
 about healthy habits was
 hanging out with people who had
 healthy habits.
 And in some ways, it was really
 lucky and fortunate, like you
 guys invited me to that
 retreat you did.
 And in some ways, I'm thankful
 you guys invited a loser like
 me, because I was hanging out
 in that group.
 I came and at first I was
 cynical and grumpy.
 And eventually, just looking
 around that group, I realized,
 man, these people like this do
 things like this.
 And my cynicism, which before
 it would have been like, wow,
 people like that do stuff like
 that.
 It went down.
 And then all of a sudden I was
 like, okay, well, if people
 like this do things like this,
 that's what I need to do.
 And I think for folks that are
 thinking like, okay, well, how
 do I know what good habits
 are?
 There are so many things that I
 would have never been, what do
 you call it?
 There's the stages of habits or
 whatever.
 But I would have never even had
 the cue if I had not first
 observed it and then noticed
 like, oh wait, they're doing
 that.
 They're doing that.
 They're doing that.
 I'm the odd man out.
 And that's what motivated me to
 want to pursue some of that
 stuff.
 But if I hadn't been in that
 group and felt like, wait a
 second, like, if I want to
 belong
 here, I've got to up my game,
 right?
 It would have never happened.
 And so people like us do things
 like this has been really
 helpful for me.
 Yeah, I love that phrase.
 And one of the reasons I said
 that, oh, I wish I had thought
 that up, is because I think
 it applies so deeply to a lot
 of the ideas in Atomic Habits.
 It applies to how socially
 reinforced our habits are.
 I think this is, you know, I
 wrote about this in the book.
 I mean, I have a whole chapter
 on it.
 Chapter nine is all about that.
 But I think I still undersold
 the importance of how socially
 reinforced our habits are.
 And then it also references the
 importance of a shared identity
.
 I think that ultimately a
 shared identity is really one
 of the most powerful forces for
 getting habits to stick.
 You know, like if you look at,
 if you look at it in a big way,
 you can look at like religions,
 you know, people, religions are
 really interesting places to
 look for habits.
 People get in the habit of
 going to church every Sunday
 for 50 years, largely because
 it's reinforced.
 The other people in their
 neighborhoods go, the people on
 their block go, they see their
 friends there.
 They, it's a very socially
 reinforced habit.
 Same thing is true in smaller
 ways.
 Like let's say you move into a
 new house and you walk outside
 on Tuesday night and you
 see all your neighbors have
 their recycling bins out.
 And you're like, huh, people
 like us do things like this.
 Like people who live in this
 neighborhood recycle on Tuesday
 nights.
 I guess we need to sign up for
 recycling.
 And there are really almost an
 infinite range of examples that
 are like that, both large
 and small, where our habits are
, we notice them because the
 people around us are doing
 them, which is what the Q
 portion is you referenced.
 We desire to do them.
 We crave to follow through on
 them because by doing the same,
 we fit in or signal to
 the other people around us, Hey
, I get it.
 I'm part of the tribe too.
 It becomes easier to do it
 because sometimes you have
 friends helping you out, you
 know,
 like it's like having a spotter
 at the gym.
 Like, Oh, people like us to
 help each other out when a set
 is hard.
 And then ultimately it becomes
 satisfying because you enjoy
 being praised for it.
 You know, other people are like
, Hey, it was great to see you
 at church on Sunday or, you
 know, really good job on that
 workout today.
 And that feels good to be
 praised for fitting in.
 And so in that way, socially
 reinforced habits or the
 collective identity, it hits
 all four
 stages of habit formation.
 And I knew that when I was
 writing it, but I don't think I
 gave it as much importance
 as I should have.
 It's a very powerful driver of
 behavior in the long run.
 Yeah, totally.
 And I think this is why cyn
icism is such a toxic attitude.
 And you know, I'm, I guess I'm
 in Gen X.
 I'm born in 1980.
 There's a lot of cynicism in
 Gen X.
 And then millennials also have
 a little bit of this too.
 And I think, and actually to be
 honest, everybody has it.
 Baby boomers have it when, you
 know, if you're a 50 year old
 programmer and you're, you get
 hired at a startup where the
 CEO is 20 years old, we kind of
 default to cynicism.
 And it, it, it's such a blocker
 when you're like trying to
 observe those norms like, Oh
 wait, like people like us do
 things like this.
 Cynicism allows you to go, well
, yeah, people like that do
 stuff like that.
 That's good for them.
 That's good for James Clear.
 But you know, that's not good
 for me.
 And when I'm trying to kind of
 reveal from my experience for
 anyone that ever watches
 this or listens to this is that
 you really do need to step
 outside that and at least
 be open to this idea that your
 life could get better.
 And it could just be going,
 okay, well, I'm going to, I'm
 going to vote for who I'm going
 to be today and I'm going to
 vote for who I'm going to be
 tomorrow and I'm going to
 keep going.
 The other thing in the book
 that really helped me and I'll
 probably butcher it so you
 clean
 up after I do it, but you show
 this grid.
 So imagine like on this side of
 your day, it's like, okay, I
 make a good decision.
 So it goes up.
 And then I make another good
 decision.
 It goes up.
 But then I make a bad decision.
 Like I eat a tub of ice cream
 and you know, sometimes eating
 the tub of ice cream is like
 debilitating.
 It's like, well, I'm done.
 I ate the tub of ice cream.
 I suck at this.
 I'm just going to go get into
 bed and forget about it.
 And in your grid, you show,
 wait, but you're still up here.
 Like you can just make another
 good decision and then you're
 back up again.
 And I like that idea of kind of
 navigating your ideas, not
 being so hard on ourselves.
 Did I kind of get that right?
 Yeah.
 So this is the, I don't know if
 you can see it, but this is the
 image.
 But it's, it's a, it's this
 idea that like the difference
 between a good day and a bad
 day is often just a series of
 choices, right?
 And you can win each little
 moment, right?
 You can win each decisive
 moment just because you ate the
 tub of ice cream doesn't mean
 you can't win the next moment.
 And, and so one thing that I
 was thinking about when I wrote
 that is this concept that
 I call decisive moments.
 This idea that there are a few
 choices each day, maybe
 somewhere between say five and
 10 that kind of determine the
 next chunk of time.
 And so, so for example, there's
 a moment for me each morning
 where I sit down and either
 I open up Evernote and I start
 writing the next start.
 I'll call, I'm going to work on
, or I go to ESPN and I check
 the latest sports news.
 And what happens in the next
 hour is really determined by
 what happens in like the first
 45 seconds.
 You know, like, do I, do I go
 to Evernote or do I go to ESPN?
 And so that is a decisive
 moment in my language.
 That's like a moment that
 determines if I can master
 those 45 seconds, then I can
 end
 up mastering the next hour that
 comes afterward almost
 automatically.
 Same thing is true.
 There's a moment each night,
 like 515 or so, my wife gets
 home from work and either we
 change into our workout clothes
, or we like sit on the couch
 and watch reruns the office
 and order Indian food or
 whatever.
 And both of those nights are
 good nights, but the moment to
 master is do we change into
 our workout clothes or not?
 If we do that, it only takes a
 few minutes.
 Everything else for the next
 two hours is already decided.
 We'll get in the car, we'll
 drive to the gym, we'll do the
 reps, like it's all, it's all
 pretty much done at that point.
 So the reason I like bringing
 that up or like thinking about
 that is you start to really
 realize there really isn't that
 much that you need to master.
 Really you just are trying to
 focus your attention on a few
 key decisive moments throughout
 the day.
 It's kind of like applying judo
 to your life.
 It's like apply the pressure
 and the leverage at just the
 right point and then the next
 hour kind of falls into place
 automatically.
 And so I like that because once
 you realize that, once you kind
 of identify those high
 leveraged decision points, you
 can organize your day and your
 environment around those
 things.
 If I know that those 45 seconds
 where I'm choosing between E
vernote or ESPN is a real
 key moment, well, I could
 install freedom and then I
 could block ESPN from 8am to 10
am
 and that takes care of that
 decisive moment and it
 increases the odds that I'm
 going to
 open it instead.
 But anyway, so little choices
 like that are easier to make
 once you've identified some
 of those key points of leverage
.
 Yeah, and you talk in the book
 like there's some tricks to
 where you can make things
 automatic.
 You talk about Nira y'all
 buying a little device that
 just shuts off his internet
 every
 night at 10am.
 Yeah, yeah, outlet timer.
 Yeah, and what's brilliant
 about that is like it shuts it
 off, like especially if it's in
 the basement or whatever, like
 you're not going to go
 downstairs and like fiddle
 around
 with it and then it's just,
 that's what happens, right?
 If ESPN was really killing you,
 you could just cancel your
 cable subscription, that
 might be a bit, but then you go
 to watch ESPN, you can't, right
?
 It's done.
 By the way, you mentioned this
 in the book too, but it's so
 funny how certain people's,
 it is a trigger for some people
 is not for others.
 Like ESPN for me is not a, that
's not a temptation at all.
 Yeah, it doesn't even enter
 your worldview.
 Doesn't enter my worldview, but
 it shows you how identity is so
 much a part of this.
 If I was hanging out with a
 bunch of Oilers fans every
 single day, and this happened
 in
 the co-work office, there's a
 few people and they're watching
 Oilers games on their computers
,
 but I realized like if I want
 to talk to them, I've got to
 start watching Oilers games.
 So people like us do things
 like this.
 And so I started developing
 this habit of watching Oilers
 games when, before I didn't
 even care.
 I think that, I mean, I think
 this is one of the reasons why
 sports is so tribal, why
 people get so emotional about
 it, is that it becomes a
 connection point for the
 relationships.
 It's not even, the game is
 actually, no one would ever say
 that because everybody acts
 like the game is the thing that
 matters the most.
 But in a weird way, it's kind
 of a secondary thing.
 Really, like when I think back
 for me, sports is a way for my
 brother and I to connect and
 for us to have something to
 text about and chat about
 throughout the week.
 It's a thing that, it's a
 reason for my dad and I to get
 together in person and to go
 to games and hang out.
 And like it's all the other
 stuff that it provides that
 makes it so deeply meaningful.
 And then you end up assigning a
 lot of that emotion to how the
 team does on the field
 as well, you know, the scores
 on the scoreboard.
 But yeah, it's a good example
 there.
 On that topic then, and this is
 Corey Stone is asking this in
 chat, but there's a lot
 of people on Twitter that ask
 this too.
 Given that example that you
 just gave, if your meaningful
 relationships are engaging in
 habits that might not be good
 for you or that you want to
 change, how do you navigate
 that?
 So if you're really feeling
 like I got to stop watching
 sports, it's just like I get
 a little bit and then I just go
 crazy, but I still want to have
 a relationship with my
 brother.
 This is where it gets complex,
 especially if you're married to
 somebody.
 If your wife is at least
 somewhat inclined to want to go
 to the gym, I'm guessing.
 But if she was like, no, I just
 want to watch Netflix and order
 Indian food.
 That's all I want to do.
 How do you start to navigate
 those things?
 Yeah, those are good questions.
 I mean, it's really hard
 because especially if it's a
 person who you want to stay in
 your
 life, you know, I think first
 of all, I just want to say, so
 I have some things I want
 to add to this, but I feel like
 it's worth noting that this
 question comes up a lot.
 And I think the reason it comes
 up a lot is because we all know
 that actually there isn't
 a good, easy answer and that it
's like just a hard part of life
.
 You know what I mean?
 Like everybody wants, it's one
 of those things we want to keep
 asking about in hopes that,
 oh, maybe there'll be an easy
 way to resolve this.
 But I think we all know like it
's a challenge.
 Now that said, there are a few
 things you can do.
 So first thing is sometimes
 your friends and family want to
 do something different than
 how you want to change.
 So like you want to stick to a
 new diet, they want to eat the
 old way or something like
 that.
 So you want to start doing yoga
, they couldn't care less about
 yoga.
 They don't want to go to class
 with you.
 Things like that.
 Well, if that's the case, then
 for certain habits, you don't
 have to like fire your friends
 and family to be able to do
 that.
 But what you can, what you do
 need or what can be really
 useful is having like a sacred
 space where that occurs where I
'm not saying you need to do
 this with me, but just don't
 make it harder on me, right?
 Just don't conflict with.
 So the yoga example is an
 easier one where it's like,
 well, maybe you need to go to a
 yoga studio away from the
 friends and family that aren't
 interested and start to build
 friendships with people who are
.
 I'm not saying you need to get
 rid of your old friends, but
 maybe it'd be helpful to
 build a couple of new ones who
 are into yoga so that you have
 like a safe space for that
 habit to live.
 So that's one thing.
 Then there's the second piece,
 which is sometimes you're
 building a habit that you do
 want the
 person to like join you on to
 come along with you.
 You're working out and you
 would love for your spouse to
 join you at the gym or
 something
 like that.
 Everybody know it like it would
 be good, but maybe they feel
 less comfortable there than
 you do.
 Or maybe they feel you were
 previously an athlete and they
 were not.
 And so you feel kind of
 comfortable in the gym.
 You've been there before in
 years past, but for them it's
 like new and weird and they
 feel
 like they're being judged and
 whatever.
 If you're dealing with a case
 like that, the thing that I try
 to keep in mind and I can
 tell you from working with my
 own family, it can be
 incredibly useful is praise the
 good ignore the bad.
 It's very hard to do.
 It's very the difficult part
 about it is not doing it on an
 individual basis.
 It's that this needs to be the
 new lifestyle for you.
 So when they do the thing that
 you're asking them to do, don't
 basically another way to
 phrase this is don't criticize
 people for doing what you were
 hoping they would.
 There are so many times when
 the introverted kid in the
 family will come down to the
 dinner
 table and it's like, oh, look
 who decided to join us.
 It's like, well, they finally
 did the thing that you were
 hoping they would do and engage
 with everybody.
 And now they just feel like
 they're getting criticized for
 it.
 Or you go to the gym and your
 spouse decides to join you and
 they do a few sets and then
 they feel like they're done.
 And you say, well, that was a
 pretty short workout.
 And what you should be saying
 is I think it's great that you
 got in here tonight, right?
 Like you weren't feeling it,
 but you were still able to make
 it in.
 And so praise the good ignore
 the bad.
 And if you can do that in the
 long run, what ends up
 happening is everybody likes
 feeling
 praised.
 Everybody likes feeling
 rewarded.
 It feels satisfying to do
 something that the people who
 love you and who are around you
 praise you for.
 And so at first you go to the
 gym and they say, hey, I'm
 really proud of you for getting
 in here tonight.
 Good job.
 And it doesn't seem like much.
 But then after two months and
 three months and 10 months of
 that, you turn around a year
 later and they might never even
 say it.
 But implicitly what they've
 realized is, damn, every time I
 go to the gym, it feels good.
 They compliment me.
 And that so now all of a sudden
 you start to associate going to
 the gym with feeling
 good.
 And this is a really long game
 play because it takes a while
 for that to reinforce itself.
 But same thing like the intro
verted kid at the table sits
 down and they say something
 that happened today.
 And it's like, oh, that's
 awesome.
 Thanks for sharing that with us
.
 And like on that individual
 night, that one night at dinner
 doesn't count for a lot.
 But if every time they speak up
, they're rewarded for it, then
 all of a sudden now they have
 a reason to start doing that
 more in the months and years to
 come.
 So it takes a while.
 But I think that that's like an
 effective way to gradually n
udge people in the right
 direction.
 Yeah.
 There's someone in the chat
 that's saying they need to
 apply that idea to themselves
 to avoid feeling guilty for not
 doing enough.
 So instead of reinforce, oh,
 you idiot, you didn't go to the
 gym again.
 You fatty.
 You know, like that's not
 helpful.
 Because the self talk, it can
 work with self talk as well.
 This is why I think small
 habits can be so useful in some
 ways, even on the bad days,
 because like, let's say you're
 in that situation you just said
 where it's like, oh, you know,
 skip the gym again.
 Yeah.
 Well, you can still do one push
 up or one air squat or whatever
 before you go do a set
 of 10 air squats before you hop
 in bed tonight.
 And it's not going to transform
 your body, but that's not
 really the point.
 The point is to prove to
 yourself that it wasn't a good
 day.
 I didn't have the best
 motivation or energy.
 I had a long day at work, but I
 still am not the type of person
 who misses workouts.
 I still proved to myself.
 I still cast a vote for being
 that kind of person.
 I didn't let a day go by
 without doing nothing.
 And that can count for a lot in
 the long run.
 And so sometimes small habits
 are less about the outcome they
 deliver and more about the
 identity they reinforce.
 Yeah.
 So I actually found, you know,
 another thing I tried to, I'm
 implementing in the new year
 is I decided to quit drinking
 alcohol.
 And right now it's ostensibly
 for this goal of hitting a
 revenue mark once I hit the
 goal,
 then I can have a drink.
 But the deeper motivation for
 me was I just realized like it
 just makes, it's a depressant.
 It's like there's a bunch of
 reasons that it's not good for
 me.
 And so my excuse or my way of
 trying it out is saying, well,
 I'm going for this goal.
 But it's been interesting in
 social situations because all
 my friends still drink and that
's
 fine with me.
 But sometimes just sharing the
 goal, oh, I'm just doing this
 because I'm going after this
 thing.
 And you talk about how goals
 are sometimes helpful in
 setting your direction, you
 know,
 like, okay, I'm pointed this
 way now.
 And sometimes sharing that with
 people is helpful.
 The other thing is, I think
 eventually if I just keep doing
 this, just for me to say,
 well, I'm a non-drinker now.
 And so I can still go and have
 my favorite, and it's also nice
 having a thing that you
 like.
 So my favorite non-alcoholic
 drink is a non-alcoholic Caesar
.
 It's like a Bloody Mary.
 And to have that drink, it's
 like kind of spicy.
 There's a reward there.
 I also have this social crutch
 that I can use in a situation,
 you know.
 And if somebody asks me about
 it, I also have this new
 identity, which is, oh, I'm a
 non-drinker
 now.
 I just don't drink.
 And you talked about that.
 There's some research behind
 that.
 I know you've mentioned it a
 lot, but it's like I'm trying
 to quit smoking versus I'm
 a non-smoker, right?
 Is that correct?
 Correct, right?
 Yeah.
 So I think that can be really
 helpful.
 Yeah.
 Having, I think what you're
 explaining here, the situation
 that you're going through, this
 experience you're having, is
 kind of, it's illustrating this
 process of identity change,
 right?
 It started with, oh, I'm just
 going to put it off for a
 little while while I'm
 attacking
 this goal.
 But then you're casting so many
 votes for like, you know what,
 I haven't drank and like,
 I'm kind of benefiting from it.
 Like maybe this is part of my
 identity now.
 Maybe I'm a non-drinker.
 And so anyway, yeah, I think
 you're definitely on the right
 track there.
 Yeah.
 And actually, this is a good
 time to bring up two Twitter
 questions.
 Maria Aldry asks, you know, how
 do you maintain habits?
 Ask him about maintaining
 habits for people with
 depression, anxiety, or
 attention deficit.
 Do you want to try to tackle
 that?
 Yeah.
 So I've tried to be careful
 about saying that atomic habits
 is about building habits and
 breaking bad habits, building
 good ones.
 But it's not a book on
 addiction.
 It's not a book on depression.
 It's not a book about anxiety
 or ADHD or any of these other
 disorders or ailments.
 And I don't consider myself an
 expert on addiction.
 However, something interesting
 has happened.
 So I published the book and I
 have had a ton of speaking
 requests recently.
 And so I've been doing speeches
 at conferences and companies
 and different events and
 whatever.
 And so many times, I get
 someone that comes up to me
 afterward or that asks a
 question
 during Q&A that talks about how
 useful the book was for their
 son who had ADHD or their
 cousin was a meth addict and
 then was able to like start to,
 you know, write the ship
 by employing some of these
 techniques or whatever.
 Yeah.
 Which is great, which is very
 gratifying.
 I still stand by my original
 statement.
 I'm not an expert on addiction.
 I don't want to like take a
 strong stance with this stuff.
 But what I've realized is that
 the principles that I lay out
 in atomic habits are really
 about how human behavior works.
 It's about how habits are
 formed.
 And whether that habit is
 something extreme, like an
 addiction or picking your skin
 or
 OCD or ADHD or whatever, or
 whether it's something more
 moderate like meditating for
 three minutes
 a day.
 The fundamentals tend to be
 similar.
 And so I'm not going to say
 that the book offers a
 prescription for overcoming add
ictions.
 But what I will say is you'd be
 hard pressed to find tactics in
 the book that wouldn't
 at least help, right?
 They wouldn't at least nudge
 people in the right direction.
 I have heard from a few readers
 who specifically have said that
 they had ADHD and they found
 the book very helpful.
 Environment design for whatever
 reason has been something that
's come up multiple times
 for folks who have struggled
 with that.
 So I think it's kind of like if
 you're the type of person who
 is less likely to just
 remember to do it, right?
 Or just follow your to-do list.
 If that's not you, then struct
uring an environment where it's
 easier to see the cues of your
 good habits, less likely to see
 the distractions, less friction
 between you and the good
 behavior,
 more friction between you and
 the bad ones.
 If you place yourself in that
 space, it's much more likely
 that you're going to fall
 through.
 You know, those are things that
 I talk about in chapters 6 and
 12.
 But I think that the book
 applies, but I don't pitch it
 as like a prescription for
 someone
 dealing with a more serious
 issue.
 Totally.
 Yeah, and I would say, again, I
'm not an expert either, but as
 someone who has been dealing
 with depression the past couple
 years, having a professional
 that you go to that deals with
 this stuff all the time like a
 therapist is so helpful.
 And the therapist will be very
 interested if you read James'
 book.
 So I said to my therapist, I'm
 like, you know, she starts way
 back here.
 And then she says, "So what's
 new with you?"
 I'm like, "Well, you know, I
 read this book and I'm thinking
, oh, what are you thinking
 about doing with that?"
 "Oh, I'm thinking about maybe
 quitting alcohol."
 "Oh, well, that's, you know,
 there's some reinforcement from
 the professionals."
 And likewise with my doctor,
 you know, when I had depression
 and I went to my physician,
 she said, she gave me two pres
criptions, quit drinking alcohol
 and quit taking any kind
 of cannabis.
 And the reason is she says, "
Those are going to make you feel
 bad."
 Now the trigger in that case
 was my doctor.
 It's nice when you have a
 doctor saying, "Listen, this is
 your prescription."
 Oh, and double the amount of
 exercise I was doing.
 So three things.
 Those, so I did that for three
 months and then, you know, I
 went back to my old habits.
 But now I have that memory of
 what it was like for three
 months and it's been a powerful
 trigger for me to, you know,
 when I am starting to notice my
 mood go down, I can, I
 remembered,
 you know, my doctor's
 prescription was quit drinking,
 quit, you know, eating edibles
 and
 doubling my exercise.
 And that's been helpful for me
 personally.
 So I think if you're reading
 the book, let your professional
 in your life know about
 it.
 It's good.
 And one thing I want you to do
 is, because I love the imagery,
 but, and this is probably
 unfair to you, is to give the
 ice cube example, but use
 Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.
 So this is an example from the
 first chapter of the book.
 And I actually, as a side note,
 I thought about this.
 I was like, man, we're going to
 have to get these changed for
 the foreign editions.
 Like we're going to, it's going
 to need to be, but anyway, so.
 Yeah, I think you can do that.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 The core idea is that the
 process of changing your habits
 is, well, it's similar to what
 we talked about early on, that
 there's often this valley of
 death, that there's this period
 where you're just kind of
 building up latent potential,
 but you're not really releasing
 any other results yet.
 And I like to equate it to the
 process of heating up an ice
 cube.
 So you've got this ice cube
 sitting on a table.
 And so let's say it's like
 negative three degrees in there
.
 So you're at negative three, it
's cold, you can see your breath
, the ice cube's sitting
 there, you heated up negative
 two, negative one.
 Still, there's this ice cube
 sitting there.
 Nothing has happened.
 Then you go from negative one
 to zero.
 And all of a sudden, you have
 this one degree shift, no
 different than any of the other
 shifts that came before it, but
 you have this phase transition,
 right?
 And like the ice cube starts
 melting.
 And that I think is indicative
 of what it often feels like to
 change a habit.
 You're making these little
 improvements, you're trying to
 make these 1% changes, these
 one
 degree shifts each day.
 And you're like, it's really
 easy to get frustrated or even
 depressed at that point.
 You know, it's like, I've been
 running for three weeks, how
 come I can't see a change
 in my body?
 Or I've been writing blog posts
 for six months now, how come
 this site isn't popular yet?
 And the key point there is your
 work was not being wasted, it's
 just being stored.
 Complaining about sticking to a
 habit for two months or three
 months or even six months
 or a year and not having the
 outcome that you want is kind
 of like complaining about
 heating an ice cube from
 negative three to negative one
 degrees and not melting it.
 The work was not wasted, it's
 just being stored.
 And I love that quote that's in
 that same section from Jacob
 Reese, who it hangs in
 the locker room of the San
 Antonio Recruitment, won five
 NBA championships.
 And it says essentially, when I
 feel like giving up, I think
 about the stone cutter
 who continues to hammer away at
 the stone a hundred times
 without it splitting.
 And then finally, on the 101st
 blow, it cracks in two.
 And I know that it wasn't the
 hundred that can't there.
 I know it wasn't the 101st
 swing that did it, but the
 hundred that came before.
 And like it's that same idea.
 You know, the reason the site
 takes off is not because of the
 one viral article, it's
 because of the 55 that you
 wrote in the weeks and months
 prior.
 The reason that you see a
 change in your body is not
 because today's workout
 radically
 transform you, it's because you
've been sticking to it for
 eight months now.
 And it's really about showing
 up, continue to put those
 swings in, continue to raise
 the temperature by one degree.
 And eventually you hit that
 phase transition where you can
 see the results of your work.
 Yeah.
 And that image has been so
 powerful in my life.
 The re like I've been telling
 people about this book and I
 actually notice there's kind
 of like a coffee shop test.
 Like if I hear people talking
 about something from Internet
 culture in a coffee shop, like
 real people, then something's
 hit and atomic habits is like
 that.
 Like it hit the kind of
 mainstream and that image of
 just raising the temperature a
 little
 bit every day.
 Now I feel like I'm a few
 months into this and I'm a
 little bit kind of like
 evangelical
 about it.
 And now I'm like, God, like my
 life is so much better.
 And it's because of just these
 little changes over time in the
 same direction.
 I can now I can see it.
 Now I can see that I feel
 better.
 You know, wow, man, quitting
 alcohol.
 That was one thing.
 And then wow, showing up at the
 gym three or four times a week,
 that really helps.
 And wow, like reading a real
 book every night before I go to
 bed.
 All of these things keep kind
 of adding up and do make a
 meaningful difference in your
 life.
 Even though way back when when
 you're starting, you feel like,
 well, nothing's going to help
 me now.
 It's I want to be clear that
 this these ideas have meaning
fully impacted my life.
 So I'm yeah, I'm really
 thankful.
 I'm thankful you wrote that
 book.
 I'm thankful you you talked to
 me in the airport.
 It's been really great for me.
 That's awesome.
 Thank you so much for sharing
 that.
 And ultimately, that's what the
 whole thing is for, right?
 I mean, it just it makes it
 feel like it was worth the
 effort to spend a few years
 writing
 it and working on it.
 So that's great.
 And so before you go, some
 people are asking like what
 recommendations for system
 services,
 tools, trackers.
 I know you have a new one
 coming out.
 Do you want to talk about that?
 Sure.
 Yeah.
 So I got it right here next to
 me, actually.
 So this is a habit journal.
 And we we just launched it two
 weeks ago.
 And it's got it's basically a
 dot grid notebook.
 So if you're into bullet journ
aling or you're into keeping a
 notebook or use a notebook,
 the vast majority of it are dot
 grid pages.
 So you'll be able to use it
 like any normal one.
 But then at the back, there's a
 section with a habit tracker
 templates.
 And I don't know if you can see
 that very well, but I've been
 using it.
 For example, this is this month
.
 So you can see me tracking my
 habits on here.
 And so anyway, those templates
 are in the back and they're
 also perforated.
 So you can tear them out and
 put them on your desk or put
 them on your kitchen counter or
 your refrigerator or whatever.
 And then and then at the very
 beginning of the book, there is
 a section called one line
 per day.
 So I've been using it for what
 happened today.
 And so I've been writing down
 what happened each day.
 And there are 31 lines.
 So one for each day of the
 month.
 And there are 12 of them.
 So by the time you get to the
 end of the year, you should be
 able to flip through and see
 if you I'm doing what happened
 today, Sean Blanc, it does what
's the highlight of the
 day.
 Some other ones that I've seen
 are what am I grateful for?
 Or you could use it as like a
 productivity thing.
 You could say like, what's my
 most important task today?
 Things like that.
 So there are a lot of examples
 in the back of the notebook who
 I have like 16 pages of
 examples of how to use it.
 But anyway, it's called the
 habit journal.
 And yeah, I'm excited about it.
 I think it'll be a good tool to
 help people build better habits
.
 And a lot of folks, I've heard
 from a lot of folks that really
 like the audiobook.
 So if you folks aren't readers,
 go check out the audiobook.
 People like us read atomic
 habits.
 So thanks again for your time,
 James.
 Really appreciate it, man.
 Awesome.
 Thank you.
 There you go.
 That was helpful for you.
 Like I said, I really recommend
 the book, Atomic Habits.com.
 That journal that he's talking
 about is also available there.
 Folks, it's 2019.
 And if you are tired of boot
strapping alone, I've been
 running an online community,
 especially
 for bootstrapers, solopreneurs,
 indie makers, and it's called
 Mega Maker Club.
 Go to megamaker.co/club.
